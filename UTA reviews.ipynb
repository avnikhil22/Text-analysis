       "'Steer clear if you are a transfer student. I have been waiting for my classes to be transferred in since May of last year and still nothing. Everyone is quick to pass the buck. My advisor doesnt really seem to care about her students and is impossible to get ahold of. I have sent emails and left messages and she didnt return any of them. I scheduled an appointment and she said she would get back with me that day and she didnt. I was unable to attend this semester due to my advisor not following through and the fact she didnt even have any appointments available until after the semester started. So far I am not impresssed and I am looking at other universities. If you are a transfer look elsewhere before considering UTA or get ready for a lot of emailing, calling, excuses, and headaches.UTA is not a large campus, it\\'s a nice size. Great opportunities if you go look for them. The professors are good people.good is nice has new things and new building therenndfkghiagcgvc agcvcdagvc ycgydagcoia gcic gia gci goidagfcoig fcoiagfcoigdsfdsiudgfiugfidag foiafy fiy gdafiy dfiiyf idf idf ids gfdgfoid gfoid gfoigdsfoidgfidsgfidsgfois fiy gfi gfi gfoiuds gfoi gdfi fiu gdfids gfoisdgfowgfoiwgf gfi fi gwfoi gwfoi wfoi fi fi gwoif gfoi gofgwfoigwfouywgf oyw foy gfoiy fy foy gfoy gfo gf efoi gfi gfoiw gefoygfy oigf yf gfy efi fioefgeyfihf ihg oigf oy gf fgfiueyfoewyfoiuewyfoiuw yfiu yfiu fiu f yefiu yewiuf f yiu yfiu yfi yfiu fiuwyefiu yfiu yfiu fiew yfoiwutfoiewgf efyi fiu fiowtefiew tfewotfoewufyoiuwytfiw ft f oif tof tf e few titfoiu oiuyf yt foiwetfywt pouft f foytfy fy tfy tewf ouwfuyew tf frMost of the psychology classrooms and math classrooms need to be updates. I have walked into a classroom so packed, no one could get to a seat without knocking over another student\\'s  laptop. The classrooms need lapel or audio services for professors who have extremely soft speaking skills. The tour only showed the most updated classroom which doesn\\'t reflect the whole campus. This campus needs a major renovation.The University of Texas at Arlington has modern archutecture that gives the campus a fresh feel. It is refreshing to see a newer campus, especially when most big universities have older architecture.There is a bit of construction happening currently and parking sucks majorly in certain areas. More parking garages would be ideal and time/space saving to be able to get to class. Most of the staff is good.I have been at the University of Texas for the past two years. I love the diversity here. The school has an amazing population of international students. Professors are extremely helpful and truly care for their students. There are a number of opportunities for students to get involved in research. News about campus activities are not well spread and I would like for their media involvement to get the news out to improve.I wish we did not have to pay for parking permits. There should be free parking for students with a permit. Everyone is friendly except the advisors should be more helpful and should give you more resources to help you succeed in school.It has been wonderful to be in this online program. The instructors have been helpful and encouraging. I would recommend this school to anyone.The University of Texas at Arlington is a great school with a vast diversity compared to other schools. The professors and academics at this school are great as long as you search up the professors rating on Rate My Professor to find your ideal professor for a class.diverse community with great academics.These attracted me because of the nursing programs and the unique geographic location. All the universities have great reputations and the students that graduate from the programs find jobs quickly. The nursing program at the University of Texas is ranked 17th in the nation. Florida State University was the first nationally ranked nursing program in the state of Florida. There is a variety of students and club organizations, which allow the school to become diverse so there are more opportunities to have a unique college experience. Another reason I chose these schools is because of the similarities to my high school, which would make adapting to the new states and environments more comfortable and familiar. The number of students in the classes are not too high like some other large schools. That makes the academic atmosphere more conducive to learning so that the professors can spend more one-on-one time with students.The nursing faculty are extraordinary and care for all students. I think there should be more campus spirit because many students are not involved. Overall I would recommend UTAThe school gives you many choices to help you study like six free tutoring sessions when you come in as a freshman and relaxation outside of class if you\\'re feeling stressed out like the University Center where all students can go to hang with friends or nap like some students. All of my professors I\\'ve had so far have been awesome and are more than happy to help you with you don\\'t understand.At UTA, you will not only have the opportunity to excel in studies but also have a great learning experience outside the classroom. There is no student problem that will be remained unsolved at UTA. They will have assistance in every which way.When I went to see go to see UTA, I really liked how they were building new apartments so more people can live on the campus. I also really liked how close by it is for me so I don\\'t have to worry about driving out further or going out of state for college. The staff there is really nice and very welcoming.I appreciate the diversity in my school. There are also resources available for students to succeed academically and career wise. There are lots of research laboratories and we\\'ll trained professionals. However, I will be happy if my school provide more scholarship opportunities for international students, they lack in that area. International students pay out of state tuition and international student fees, it\\'s a whole lot.The school is very diverse and accessible if you want to live on or off campus. You can get very involved in student life without it ever being too \"big\". Most classes aren\\'t too big and the professors are very accessible. I would like to see a football team again. Nothing else would really bring all the students together like that.It\\'s a good school but it doesn\\'t have a good campus life. There\\'s plenty of things to do in the area around the school though. The professors are good but some are hard to understand. Overall, I\\'d stay here for the education.This university is very diverse and has been quickly growing since my freshmen year.  All of my professors have been very helpful and approachable, and I have encountered many opportunities that I wouldn\\'t have found elsewhere.As an Information Systems junior at University of Texas-Arlington, I love how connected the classmates are. There are always study groups and professors willing to help you along, so you can pass your classes. The campus is clean and beautiful to walk around. I love how there\\'s always things happening and of course, the food.Diversity is the most exciting part about the school, there are so many things to do that will make someone open their eyes to really view the world. From the food to the students there is so much diversity and it is amazing. I love hanging out with people who have different beliefs than me and who are from different countries. Everyone is very accepting of others who are from a totally different world than them.Drug safety is not even a problem on campus. There are no students who drink nor do drugs and I love that. I don\\'t have to worry about a student breaking the school law or students getting hold to alcohol easily on campus. peer pressure doesn\\'t seem to exist on campus unless it is behind closed doors which it is not.My overall experience is amazing because everything that my school has to offer has been so helpful to my future success. I love my fellow classmates and professors, I also love the different clubs that are offered. Most of all I like the challenge that the school gives because it builds me up for the real world. I love how not many of my classes have a large number of people in it, I only have one class with over a 100 students in it. i love UTA and I will enjoy my college years with no complaints.Student careers are very important  to the school, so they make sure students are offered the best tools and internships while they study in their desired field. They have fairs where students can go and apply for jobs and internships to expand their experience in their field. Their are many job openings around the school that are great for volunteer hours or just to earn money.Campus safety is handled very well on campus. There is rarely any trouble that happens, but when it does happen security is quick to take care of the situation. Personal safety is definitely not a problem, student can walk across campus with no fears at all. That\\'s because campus police arrive much faster than the city police. I feel 100% safe on campus which makes my experience at UTA ten times better.Campus housing is great because the school has a program where every major has a special PAL. That PAL is like a mentor and always there for the students, so housing made a change where every PAL gets to live with the students in their groups. Plus it is a great environment where everyone gets to know each other and learn more about each other and the school. I love that the housing also comes already 95% furnished, there is not much that you have to bring except all the important belongings. All of the buildings are well kept together and a nice walk or bike ride from the school. There are also options for those who want to live off campus but close to the school with the different apartment buildings that surround the school. Students get great deals on apartments since UTA shares a partnership with the apartment complexes.The Greek life on campus is amazing and they treat non-Greeks as if they were apart of their group. Greeks are viewed as the life of the party whenever they are around. the atmosphere is never awkward there is always something to talk about or laughing that goes on. They are a great asset to the school and the different activities that are offered to new students.The school is really big in school spirit. The first day of orientation the cheerleaders along with the basketball players taught the incoming freshman all the sports song. It was a really amazing experience because they were so excited and passionate about their school song and supporting their teams. The coaches have little activity because they let the players build and help each other, they are there whenever the team needs their support and guidance. I love the athletic department at the University of Texas at Arlington, it is another great aspect to the college.University of Texas at Arlington is the best school by far, I am very proud of my decision. This school is great because the students and professors are the friendliest people I have ever met. Both are great when it comes to needing help and making sure students are on the right track to graduating. The environment is more like a family rather than a school and I love the idea of there being no problems at all that changes my opinion about the school. My favorite part about the school is how interacted they are with the students. There are always different fairs going on such as, job fairs, protest against police brutality and many more. I can\\'t imagine myself at any other school, I fit perfectly at the University of Texas at Arlington.I dont live in campus but seeing the great atmosphere here makes me want to move in next year!They dont really have a huge impact on campus from what i have seen. When i do see them at student fairs they dont really seem happy to get new recruits.UTA has one of the best gyms that i have seen, also their outdoor courts are amazing and clean.I would choose to come here again because everybody is so friendly and kind. Most schools students would say nothing and keep to themselves but UTA is different.Getting a Degree in Engineering and Nursing here is considered a great thing. Anything else is practically unimportant. Luckily I am in the process of gaining the former.Some of the courses are fast paced, but that is to be expected if you are taking higher level course than anyone else, i.e. Chemistry for Engineers, Calculus, and more. The teachers are almost always happy to help the students here and encourage us to ask questions and take advantage of there office hours. Don\\'t expect too much when it comes to English Professors teaching a segment in an ENGINEERING CLASS.There seems to be a lot of petty crimes that happen around campus. There is a clinic and police station on campus though, so student can have fast access to any help they need.I really do not know much about the Greek Life on my campus other than that there is an entire part of campus dedicated to just the housing of the Fraternities/Sororities. Some of the Band centered Fraternities/Sororities help the Marching Band during lunch and more.My school does not have a Football team, which is a big part of College Sports, especially in Texas. This may be a good thing as it allows more funding for other important things, like an education. Basketball is pretty popular here though, but the most popular things are the intramural sports. Also, for Marching Band, since we do not have a Football team, not many of the student body has even heard of the band.School has been okay the last couple of weeks. The campus is not that big compared to others so getting around is easy, especially if you have a bike. One thing though, there are a lot of Indians at this school. And many of them have very thick accents, so it sometimes becomes a frustrating to understand them during class discussions and I do not want to be rude and ask them to repeat what they said multiple times.You get what you payI think that UTA has decent housing and average social atmosphere. I think that UT Arlington has great school policies that has a lot of influence on student social life and academic. I like the University of Texas because it has a good computer lab, printing system and there tutor available if you need help in any subject. for instance math, Spanish and English. This type of group need to worry about helping student to success at school then having a lot of party.housing at UTA is just OK. They need to build more apartment close by the university with comfortable cost and space. Parking situation near UTA is very bad. there is not enough parking space on and off campus. UTA lack on parking, they need to do something about this problem. The university that I am attending has a poor dining option that it is close the school. if you would to spend a good time you need to drive a few mile away to find a good restaurant.I think my school has a decent  computer lab and printing system. it is reliable and flexible. There is a lot of interest in athletics in my school. The team spirit is palpable and the athletic facilities are great!I really dont know much because I dont live on campus.The local weather does not really affect my campus experience significantly. The shuttles are great and escorts are available after office hours.Printing on campus is cumbersome. The computer lab serving my department has few computers but overall, the tech support is great and the wireless network is very reliable.It;s great for sure. I just do not use it all the time.I think off-campus dining is just right for on campus students.The food is actually okay. You just get tired of it after a while.I think the availability of computers is just fine.The environment is just right for college students.I have not seen any suspiscious activities so far.The classes are challenging. The professors help you out when you need them.I am a BA in Chemistry major and it helps me to also minor in frenchI am currently enrolled in an online program and the academic load is sized appropriately with ample assistance when needed.The professors are accessible, registration is simple and if need they will hold your hand all the way through.The food on campus is really great they have healty fast food places such as subway to  buffet of a variety of foods Diversity at our school is the primary goal. we welcome anyone from anywhere and they can feel t home because their is special places for them to worship special things and many events for different Academics is a great value at our school, having many tutors available when needed and lots of study groups that are doing the same major as you and are mostly juniors and seniors that have already experienced what im going through and also did really good There is a variety of academic\\'s at UTA since it is the 5th most diverse university we have a lot to choose fromUTA is like a little town everything is walking distance and made for college students to enjoy and feel safe while doing itcampus housing ranges from 150-435 a month that\\'s in dorms and the higher the nicer. don\\'t get me wrong they are all meant to feel like home The wifi is really relevant around the school and everywhere you go there is always computers, but not very up to date but the networking on them works UTA always has many events going on from casino night to ozze ball  (mud volleyball),to the homecoming paradeAt my school UTA we have many was to get around that don\\'t cost a dime. like The shuttle bus goes all around campus from the football stadium to the apartments around campus. Also there is golf carts that you can call anywhere to come pick you up and take you where you need to go on campusTons of restaurants in and around campus. Most around campus restaurants are open late.You\\'re going to run into your average run of the mill people here. Very little interaction activities if you are a transfer.Make sure you have your parking pass and follow all parking regulations for the first few weeks of school because the campus police are everywhere.Other than the occasional rain the weather here is excellent. It usually is a little hot but it is Texas after all.Great town with plenty of entertainment. Six Flags is right down the road and if you want to catch a professional baseball or football game that is also right down the street.Plenty of computers, but when it is crunch time at the end of the semester it\\'s important to have your own to make sure you have access to the internet.Transportation is not really needed to get around the school. Most things are within walking distanceThere are tons of options around the school for nightlife, most places are a little bit of a drive but no more than 10-15 minutesthey\\'re very strict about frats and sororities getting drunk every weekend so many brown people here well theres been 10 thefts in the past two months so yeah bad bc i get allergies all the freakin time My chemistry professor is the best teacher in the whole world other than that all professors suck not so sure about it I didn\\'t do the alcohol survey and got no penalty for it either They need to invest a lot more in baked potatoes and sour cream Everyone does their own thing. You could go all 4 years of college without making a single friend. Not saying people here are unfriendly or stuck up, but just no one goes out of their way to make friends. Don\\'t even think about seeing attractive guys here either. I saw a meme that accurately described this, it said something along the lines of \"Don\\'t know if he\\'s cute or it\\'s just because I go to UTA\".At least the campus shuttle is free. The one thing all commuters complain about however is the parking available at UTA or lack thereof.It was neither an easy or difficult process. You just have to be aware of paperwork and other things that the Bursar office requires of you and it shouldn\\'t be too bad. Also, be mindful of your GPA because scholarship renewal depends on it being at a certain minimum.There are always crime reports being sent out and it does not make me feel safe on campus at all. However students do have the option of calling an escort so you don\\'t have to walk alone around campus at night.Need to stay open laterIt\\'s ok but could have a few more on slow weekendThere isn\\'t much nightlife at school. This school is mostly a commuter school so all the people that are at parties are at either clubs or at off campus apartments. Also I don\\'t know of many nightclubs in Arlington. I believe most of the nightclubs that students go to are either in fort worth or Dallas. Which they aren\\'t that far away, but hard to get to for people who don\\'t have cars. Also there is hardly anyone here on the weekends.I would say the guy/girl ratio and whatnot is pretty even. The guys are pretty handsome, and everyone pretty much dresses casually. Some people wear sweats, but the overwhelming majority are the t-shirt and jeans type. I really like the athletics at the school. They have intramurals that are pretty well attended. Also our main sports are well attended. Our main sport is basketball and homecoming week is pretty big. The athletic facilities are great and they have a lot of it.I would say that the campus is pretty strict about illegal things. They don\\'t want to see drugs or alcohol in the hands of underage kids. They also are really big on the honor code, and you can see it some of everywhere and also on crime. They put out things on people who commit crimes and try to stop them, but they\\'re pretty lenient on things like attendance and visitation in dorms.I would say this campus is pretty diverse. I know that they always talk about how diverse they are and they won a couple awards for it. I think you can also see the diversity when you look at the different groups that are on campus. There are various religious and ethnic and other type of organizations at the school, and it seems that pretty much everyone is accepted all the time.The student life on campus is great during the week. The athletic centers are great. The basketball stadium is really big and a lot of fun. Also the activities center is full of stuff. There is a lot of machines there, two tracks, and a lot of space to rent. Arlington has a lot of attractions. They have three big shopping centers: a mall, the highlands, and the outlet mall. Also there is the baseball stadium, the cowboy\\'s stadium, hurricane harbor, and six flags. And also there is a number of parks around Arlington. And on fridays the mall gives discounts to UTA students.I really like the campus dining. On campus we have a dining hall and then a variety of fast food options as well as a convenience store. the dining hall has a variety of food every day, although because it is more expensive, I don\\'t go as often. The \\'plaza\\' as we call it has quite a few options as well, and I usually end up going there for most of my food if I don\\'t have any at my dorm.Like any campus, there is crime, but there are ways to combat this. They have police escorts throughout the day and students can call them when they need it. There are also police stands that shine blue and when you push a button it calls a police. Seeing those and having the escorts make me feel safe on campus.I live on campus so I don\\'t know much about off-campus housing, but I do know that there are quite a bit of options for people who want to live off campus. they have off campus apartments and houses, and there are neighborhoods close enough to the school to get an apartment there as well. Most of the off-campus apartments are so close to the school that you can walk to get to campus, and they have some of the same amenities that the dorms have, but the other ones are like regular apartments.I know that some of the places off campus do give students discounts. And at some places you can use these things called dining dollars that are equivalent to money and come with meal plans. There are quite a few fast food options as well as sit down and buffet type options on cooper where UTA is located. And the cost is usually pretty good; most of the food places cost less than 10 and most others are less than 20 per person.We have quite a bit of high power computers on campus such as mac computers and printing is relatively easy. The main place to print is in the library but they have a lot of printers and it is hardly crowded. However, it would be easier to get a personal computer. There are quite a bit of online homework websites that you need to get used to, but if you don\\'t have one, the library will either rent you out one or they library is almost always open so you can go in there. also the network reliability is good and the speed and wireless access are pretty uniform throughout the campus.the weather hasn\\'t had much affect on my campus experience. It\\'s been pretty even the whole time.They have a pretty good selection, but I there are some majors they don\\'t have such as chemical engineering which I really want to be in.They have quite a bit of undergraduate research which really interests me, and I know that the work load is a little hard, but my major is everywhere.just started but so far so good.Could be worse but could be a lot betterI will purchase my own next semester for this.I am married and don\\'t pay attention to any of thisExpensive for those without a prepaid dining plan.There is a long walk from parking to COB building. Any precipitation is a bad thing.As a part time student,  I never see any drug use.The grounds are well kept.Parking is ridiculous. Lots of underage drinking. They only care about stupid stuff and dont really pay attention to the real issues Some buildings are new, some are really run down and old. Newest thing is engineering wing and the school doesnt really care about anything but engineering Greek life here is a joke. Nobody takes them seriously at all. They\\'re only good for the parties that get busted in like every single time Not good. Not terrible. Not as many options as would seem. DO NOT get the most expensive meal plan, because you will get tired of the dining hall after like two weeks Cost is ridiculous for how little spots there are. They ridiculously ticket you My experience was okay. Not good exactly. Definitely wanna go somewhere else now The police are around, and will write you tickets with no question. Many many many robberies walking around campus We are ranked one of the most diverse campuses in america for a reason. There\\'s seriously so much it\\'s ridiculous It\\'s Texas. The weather is always gonna suck. But the school can\\'t control that There is a lot of financial aid available, you just have to actually make an effort to get it The roommate process is terrible. Many of the dorms are old. The whole process was just terrible, ALWAYS GET A PRIVATE. They have plenty of resources available so help really is always there, but it still is very difficult for math and science. The science, math, and engineering classes are the most challenging, because this is an engineering schoolYeah there are computers around, but it\\'s just so much easier to have your ownGood dry campus mostly. No visible drugs everIt\\'s not bad. Not too much crime hereWould prefer to go to UTLots of diverse people. Huge melting potDallas cowboys and mavericks help the sports sceneLots of cute girls but not very open I am still new but willing to learnGreek life is okay, needs moreNot much nightlife. Go to dallasI am the kind of person that takes their own device there because the labs are always extremely crowded, but I cannot complain on the Wi-Fi it lets me do what I need to do. Lets just say that if you have class at 8 you better be there at 6:50 The school seems like a city of it\\'s own. It has its own veins and beats a complete life of its own and just like any person/place  my campus has its faults that make it extremely difficult for me to get over at times but at the end of the day it is what it is and it\\'s trying its best to stay alive. I think that many people aren\\'t as involved in sports as one imagines. Walking around campus at night is creepy.Dont park anywhere without a permit...cool greek row far from campusHas a decent amount of optionsShuttles ever so often and escortsLots of diversity and international studentsrnThe surrounding area is ghetto.The library is the place to be for all your study needs, provides hangouts, quite study areas, computer labs, cafe, printers and much more.UT Arlington parking is quite a mess I\\'ve tried going their 30-60 minutes before class starts to no luck and even several hours before hand, the spots get taken up really early and are only empty in the afternoonEvery person I\\'ve meet at UT Arlington is different whether it be race, religion, nationality but in the end everyone gets along quite nicely. Every type of restaurant scene you can ask for, however the Arlington is flooded with fast food places so many of these gems are hidden.There are lots of sports here except football. So the main sports people attend are basketball and volleyball. The basketball team nearly made it into the NCAA tournament 2 straight years. So i hope next time they can make it.The whole point of sports is to teach teamwork, instill life long lessons, and to some degree win games. But if your team isn\\'t winning it is an immediate reflection of your campus. That is the problem at UTA. When the basketball team loses a game the entire campus feels like they have lost. which over the years has caused students not to participate in a lot of those activities.Never have i had a fear of being on campus. But to be honest when your race is the majority, there really isn\\'t anything to feel uncomfortable for. But I\\'ve seen many individuals uncomfortable. I believe it can be a frightful experience to be dropped off in an unfamiliar environment and asked to adapt. The campus is remarkably safe though.It obviously isn\\'t the universities fault. But arlington is simply a city that has developed itself. Over the years its slowly digressed into a city that is visualized as poor. It is also going through a large economical change. Which will offer better options with living. But at a much higher price.there is always something to eat around campus. wingstop and chicken express I know for sure have a student discount. there is also a chiptole not far from the schoolIt is a smoke free campus. however if you do get caught on campus or on campus dorms/ apartments there are serious consequencescomputers are great on campus. they even have Mac\\'s in the library! however during crunch times it does get quite crowded. Printing is 10cents. the speed is great, like your the only one on the internet. Personal computer is cool to bring with you regardless but if you must get on one of the computers on campus just know the right times to go to the libraryI will be taking online classes, so my safety and security on the campus is not an issue.I believe there is a great selection of off-campus dining to be enjoyed by all.I have been accepted to the program and anxiously awaiting to start my first class.  I am currently trying to get my finances together to pay for my classes.  I am in debt with student loans for my daughter\\'s education at Oklahoma State University, that is why I am looking for a scholarship for my education.  Therefore I am unable to tell what I like about my school\\'s program.They\\'re very strict which is a great thing because it keeps the students save.  Also it keeps the rules of conduct clear and concise so that not everyone is going to do the wrong things all the time.I have not applied for financial aid, I have been accepted to UTA for my BSN, currently working full time and putting my daughter through college at OSU.I don\\'t notice the drug scene at school because I concentrate on doing my school work and getting the most that I can out of my classes.  There\\'s no obvious drug use that I have noticed.Transportation is very convenient.  It mets the needs of most people, I would say. Transportation is available to accommodate different hours that students will be uses it.The University Center at UTA is not that big but there Is a variety of foods that people can choose from. Also, the MAC (activity center) is rather nice with plenty of work out machines and an indoor track.The drug safety at UTA is getting better in my opinion ever since they made it a tobacco free campus.Sports are very important, try to get people more active and involvedstudents seem to have a good time, many friendshipsa lot of down time, rooms are crowdedI think it\\'s great that uta ha  it\\'s own bus that has no stops, only from and to the universitythere\\'s all kind  of people hereI believe that the Uta has good academics.Program criteria not outlined until admittedReasonable rent rates and good selectionLong, hot summers and short, mild winters.The campus is vibrant and full of things to do. The campus could use a few pedestrian bridges or tunnels since students are constantly crossing the streets.Parking requires either parking passes or spending a lot on parking meters for a short periodThe financial aid process was not too difficult. If you have to cal them though you may have to sit on hold for a while.I can usually never find a spot in the lot that is closest to my class.So if you are okay with arriving early and walking a bit then it is not that bad.The bookstore is awesome but their policy sucks!All is fair in school and finances. But for the program I am applying to, I need money to pay for the classes itself. So that means more loans and more debt. Times are tough. That has to be an easier way to pay for school.Good amount of grants if you look for them.Drugs are around, just like any university. Mostly smoking or alcohol use, but most students are not involved in drug use.Not much social interaction at UTA. There is a lot of clubs and bars to go to in the surrounding DFW area, but not much around the campus itself.It all depends on the field you study. Some range from extremely difficult and time consuming (Architecture) to pretty lax and easy going (Business) with all the in between. Its usually a hit or miss with the teachers. There\\'s always a few bad apples in the bunch.This is the great state of Texas where we can have all 4 season packed into one day. The winters are bitter with good chances of ice, but no snow. The summers are extremely hot and humid with very little rain. The spring and fall however are some of the most beautiful in all the country with mild temperatures.You will find just about everything here. A lot of people think because of our science based programs there are just a bunch of nerds but this is not so. There are many attractive people and most people on campus are easy to talk to and are willing to make room for more friends.The computer labs can definitely get crowded so I would suggest you bring a laptop. Printing is a fairly reasonable price as long as you find a computer on which to release a printing job. I honestly feel like the school should invest in more computer labs.It really all depends on your major here at UTA. Some majors are easier than others in amounts of workload and studying, such as majors in the college of science, nursing, engineering, and architecture. There are always places to study on campus the only thing I would say is if you want to study with a group you have to search for students on your own. I have not been introduced to any SI sessions being here on campus but I have met up with people from my classes to study and that has been somewhat effective. The professors here are great, all of mine show passion for what they\\'re teaching which makes the courses more enjoyable.I am actually in a dual program at UTA that allows students to work on a pre-medical degree in biology and get a masters in healthcare administration. Honestly I do not know very many people pursuing this career and I associate more with students who are biology pre-med just because I can relate to them. But my advisor is very helpful and we meet before choosing classes each semester which is very beneficial. The work load is tough because it is a dense amount of biology along with business classes and I work part-time as well. All of my professors are great but the material is definitely challenging and I think they should incorporate SI sessions and more tutoring opportunities.Parking is terrible. I always have to park two streets away from campus which then takes about 10 minutes to walk to class.There were variety of restaurants off-campus but it can get very crowded, usually at night.I have been very pleased with the RN - BSN nursing program. The instructors are very educated, informative and accessible. The program is fast paced, but allows time for self reflection. I would strongly recommend this program to other nurses looking to pursue a higher degree.For me this is not applicable, as I am pursuing an online degree through UT-Arlington.I am a Computer Science major, and most of my professors are foreign, such as Indian, or Chinese. It is kind of hard for me to follow them in class. To deal with that, I have to reread the material at home. Waste a lot of my time. However, the professors are all helpful. I am taking 18 credits and the workload for me right now is ok, not too much.There are a lot of different majors offered in my school. Currently, I am taking History and English as general education courses, and I like my professors. Their lectures are clear and interesting.I think it\\'s pretty safe in my campus. There are people everywhere, and Arlington is a safe town.I live on campus and the dorm I live in (KC Hall) requires a meal plan. There are multiple meal plans for resident students, but also for commuters. I love the cafeteria. The menu is different everyday and you can view it online, including the calorie breakdown. They serve a diverse menu, from comfort food, pizza, salad bar, wraps, international (Hispanic, Indian...), soups, desserts (cookies, ice cream, cheese cake)... OOOuuuuh and every month, they have a bug birthday cake for the babies of that month... I love the cafÃ©. But you also have subway, panda, pizza hut and other cool restaurants in case you don\\'t like the cafÃ© or don\\'t have the meal plan.UTA is very diverse. You see people from different ethnic, religious, cultural background and there are different clubs on campus which you can join to feel welcomed.The UTA police patrols very often and is very strict, especially when it comes to parking, safety and excess speed.loading up the computers are slow but i guess its from everyone using the computers. The internet speed is below average. may have to wait about 5 seconds for a page to load. Printing on campus is pretty good with a good price to pay for printing. 4 cents for black and white and 6 cents for color.Its Texas so the weather is random some days. It may be hot one day but then cold the next. It sometimes snows randomly out of nowhere. For the most part its hot during the summer and cold during the fall and winter time.Its a great atmosphere. There is always some kind of event going on every week. Near by are several restaurants with different kinds of cultural food. If you don\\'t attend to whats going on then you are missing out on a lot of fun.The campus has I dining facility that has a wide variety of choices, as well as a fair selection of fast food establishments in a central area.  There are also a number of restaurants within walking distance of campus.There are a number of computer lab on campus with high speed internet as well as WiFi hots posts through out the campus.  There is also a help desk for individuals that are having computer issues.The parking is horrid because most of the campus is fighting for parking spaces. Many student just begin to park in the apartments parking spaces. There are many places to stay but most of the locations are old and some unsafe so you have to be really careful when choosing.There are lots of diners around the campus to choose from including some very low cost places.The workload as a nursing student is tremendous. The program expects us to not work but to be able to afford all of the books, scrubs, equipment, and other things on basically no money. The teachers here all believe that they are the only course and the most important so they throw unreasonable amounts of course work and unnecessary clinical paperwork at you. I am very disappointed with this program.I came to UTA because of their nursing program but I noticed that the advisors here do not support you and the teachers are all very distant and aloof when it comes to student needs.UTA is a commuter school which means parking in nonexistent and you have to walk a good stretch to get to class most days, in rain, sleet, or snow. This is also Texas so it is hot year round.The drug scene at UT Arlington isn\\'t preeminent, but I have come across situations where people I know engage in those activities. It\\'s said quite often, but it really does matter what kind of people you surround yourself with. So while I don\\'t much of the drug scene, I do know it happens, though not severely. For all Freshman, UT Arlington does require you to complete an online mini course about drugs and drinking. It exposes you to \\'what this stuff is all about\\' and it gives you suggestions to how to deal with those situations if you ever find yourself in them.The computer labs at UT Arlington are pretty abundant. However, during finals or midterms, it does become quite crowded so it becomes difficult to find a spot. When you log on to a campus computer, it lags and is quite slow at first, but once it warms up it\\'s considerably reliable. Most of the computers have all the softwares you need, like Word or Powerpoint. They have a great printing system, and its very inexpensive. (Although the only downside, from what I\\'ve experienced, is that you have to print from a UTA computer, and aren\\'t able to from your laptop.) The WiFi speed is quite good, but logging in is quite inefficient. Having your own computer may be more convenient, but it wouldn\\'t be detrimental if you didn\\'t have one.UT Arlington only has off-campus housing; either apartments set up near the school for students (no dorms) or you can rent a place nearby. If you are wanting to live near campus, prices are very reasonable, but the neighborhood is rather ghetto.It\\'s Texas, it tends to be either really hot or cold. The only way I can see that this plays into my campus experience is that parking is terrible and the closest available parking spots are 1/2-1 mile from each of my classes so being subjected to poor weather conditions tends to be not a fun experience.Varies from nice and updated for some buildings to gross in others. There are a lot of good outdoor and indoor study areas, as well as a pretty good food mall.I went to a 2-yr community college before transferring to UTA. The basic policies and procedures are similar, and I have never had any problems for the most part. The only complaint I can offer is that some of the junior/senior programs are very stringent. 77 or below is failing and if you miss more than 1 class, your final grade is lowered by an entire letter grade (i.e. a 3.0 turns into a 2.0). At least in my program, due to the way the classes are set-up, there is zero flexibility with taking a semester off due to illness or anything else (you cannot skip a semester and come back, you must wait 1 year).The quality of professors vary. In most courses, the teachers are very professional and kind. However, in some of the \"basics\" classes the university employs student teachers, many of which are inexperienced (I even had one that spoke such poor English that I could not understand him - and this was algebra!) The building qualities vary depending on the class and location. Some are very nice and updated, while others will flood if it rains, have graffiti all in the bathrooms, and have tripping hazards with carpet peeling up and not being repaired. The school does not have a large enough server to accommodate high volume traffic, such as registration time or  when classes start, and will often crash or fail to load pages. The same lack of spending causes a lot of issues in dealing with services such as financial aid, as the phones will always be busy and it is standard for the tuition bill/ FA to get the finances messed up, then be a hassle in order to get it fixed; considering though, that this is the lowest priced 4-yr university near me ($13k base yearly tuition), I feel it worth the extra hassle. The grounds are very nice and generally kept clean and in good order.Financial aid can be frustrating but talking to the right people and the department supervising helps.I try to avoid fast food, but the authentic ethnic restaurants are good and I am always looking for others.Texas weather is inconsistent so it is hard sometime to enjoy the weather on campus.I\\'m happy with the program but I won\\'t do it again. My goal is to become a dentist but I do have concerns about the competitiveness when it comes to acceptant rate.UTA doesn\\'t really have a drug scene. If there is any usage of drugs, it\\'s definitely kept on the down low so peer pressure is not a problem. Policy regarding drugs is pretty strict anyhow.It\\'s Texas so it\\'s really hot. The weather is all over the place no matter what season so it\\'s kind of a drag sometimes to be outdoors. When the weather is nice though, there are lots of outdoor activities to do.I love the local atmosphere at UTArlington! The campus is beautiful and safe and there are so many fun things to do. The Maverick Activities Center is a great place for sports and hangouts. There are also many on-campus dining facilities that have many options for all kinds of food.As far as on-campus activities go, I haven\\'t encountered any issues. The different housing areas though do seem to have some problems but I don\\'t really get into those types of scenes anyway.Since I live on the completely opposite side of the cafeteria its a long walk. The food is great. There are always different kinds.I live in the apartments near UTA. But from what I\\'ve heard about the dorms it is very convenient since its really close to the cafeteria.The atmosphere at UTA is really friendly. There\\'s always someone trying to help you. There are always activities to get the new freshmen together, specially at the beginning of the school year.No football in a Texas school. Everything else is alright.Downtown Arlington is limited. Bars and greasy food.person I spoke to did not take the time to review my special circumstance document and turned me away immediately.There are some apartments close to the campus.  They are either new and high priced or semi affordable but not kept up.  I think safety is a big concern and only look for places that have some security.I am very happy with my major and would choose it again.  My plans are to get my bacholars in Exercise Science and then get my masters in Athletic training.  I have high hopes in getting a great job when I get out.You need to have a good gpa and the program is limited in number to how many they accept.  I think the application process is pretty normalYou have to arrive on campus very early in the morning to get a parking spot.The guys at UTA are pretty normal. Girls don\\'t fall head over heels for them.I can only speak from what I\\'ve seen. I attend a school that does not have a football team, so that\\'s a big minus point. However, the volleyball team is great, and the MAC- which is the athletics building is very nice. The building is open to all students and the staff is very friendly.Being a first-time college student was really a push into the real world. Everything that they tell you in high school about college is true! Luckily I have some amazing professors that are available to help, and they are enthusiastic about their job.Applying for scholarships is easy and simple with no complications and right to the point. Recommend it for anyone looking to start of who is not sure what they are looking for.This school is great! I really love the theatre department and the groups I am a part of.Many students can expect to get a job after graduation.I feel pretty safe on campus. I am comfortable walking alone unless it is night, but that is personal preference.I live in Arlington Hall and I love it! I have a suite and it is great because I get my own room.I personally do not like Greek Life, but others seem to enjoy the Greek Life here.The students and faculty at the school really care about the athletics available.I really like my school. Originally I was going to transfer out, but now I am seriously considering staying.the teachers really care, and there are a lotta options so anyone can persue what they want. there are very few limitations when it comes to academics.diversity is a big thing here, but everyone is accepted no matter your religion or race or physical/mental appearance.i mean some parties there will be alcohol but its college, so it\\'s just naturally expected. there aren\\'t people always walking around drunk, and you hardly see it outside of a few restraunts and the parties.I am a little biased since this is the first college i have attended,  but i think that it is all great and that the campus as a whole is reaslly open and welcoming to everyone.There is a lotta security on campus, espesially in the dorms, and i don;t have any concerns about it. The administrators and staff make sure that every student is safe and taken care of.Hosing on campus ios very good and there are a lotta choices for students. It is kinda hard to be able to live on campus if you wait to long to apply for a dorm but once you get it it is a good experience and a great opportunity that i think everyone should have at least once.i don\\'t know much about greek life but i know that a lotta people are in sororities and fratenities and that they are a big part of the uta community.Students on campus are always getting involved and they show a Lot of school spirit. Sports are a big thing for this school, and they help everyone get to know one another and they also give a lotta students confidence in themselfs.It is diverse and the teachers all care about their students being successful. There are a lotta activities and clubs on campus and it is really easy to find a group to hang with. I am reccommending this school to my high school friends because it is such a great experience, and one i\\'ll never forget.I live off campus and commute to school every day, but I have been inside the dorms and they are beautiful! For the nicest dorms, it costs almost $5000 a year and you are required to have a meal plan with the nicer dorms, which is almost $4000 a semester. In my opinion, that is too much for dorms, but in comparison to other schools in Texas, it is very reasonable. The dorms have a lot of space, comfy beds, and lots of storage! My friends who live in dorms love it! There are also plenty of study lounges in every dorm building!Most of of the people at the University of Texas at Arlington are either white or indian. This is compensated by everyone being so nice.The UTA atmosphere is cozy but busy.  Cowboy stadium is down the street, the school itself is trying to get a solid sports program going, and there\\'s an excellent stadium on campus.  I\\'ve seen the school spirit and it\\'s great, though the school song could use a LOT of work.  When on campus you almost feel like you can relax but it just never happens.There are several places to dine on campus. With many choices to fit any need of style of student; whether it be to conserve money, eat a vegan lifestyle, or to load up carbs while cramming for finals (pizza... yummy).I often have to resend my papers via fax. This particular semester (Fall 2013) it would seem they misplaced a form I had faxed two times. With out proof however I can\\'t positively state the department was fully at fault. There is the possibility I somehow messed up the transaction myself. I ended up hand delivering the form several weeks after the posted due date. Despite the belated entry I received the aid intended for me this coming semester.One prominent component of the students that attend this college is the tremendous diversity in interests. Taking a typical stroll through the complex usually results in the encounter of live music from every genre. Everyday there are organizations recruiting students that share the same goals, major, interests, etc.. One other quality I have noticed is the variety of age groups. Not all students attending are right out of high school, such a mix gives a healthy dose of crazy fun with a mature attitude.The food is good and there is always a good crowd.everything is in walking distance, unless you\\'re just lazy.Certain classes fill up too soon and that postpones taking the classes that you need until the next semester or even during the summer.There are some people that like to run off with things.  The cops make a report on it and it does not seem like anything gets done to stop the problem or catch them.Most of the classes and instructors have been great.  The facilities are well maintained.The student life is exciting since you meet new people while going out. Also there are many events and clubs people can join that is related to their majors.The transportation is good since they have buses that can get you from point a to point b. Also you can park at certain areas and let the bus take you to your destination.The school is very diverse and has people from a lot of different backgrounds.The Greek life is all about exciting events and parties. Also about meeting new people and feeling the student life style.At my school there is a variety of food to eat that is nearby like Indian, Chinese, Mexican, and gyros. The food is not as expensive and its very affordable.The school is very safe and the health center is close to your convenience.My school has one of the top nursing programs in Texas. All the buildings are not as far apart from each other. We have lots of different programs to study for, plus there are monthly programs. Also it is a very diverse and fun school. Lastly, my school has exciting events and sports never played in other schools like wheelchair basketball.We do have buses but they are fairly slow to get places.Well they have Campus police patrolling, fairly lit camps grounds. There are still occasional issues but usually nothing beyond a robbery.  They ALWAYS have an alert system going out if there is an kind of issue no matter how small.Aside from the club/ bar scene Arlington has a lot to offer with the Rangers Ballpark and Cowboy Stadium just down the street.  Six Flags down the road and a couple of malls and Recreational places. But bars/Clubs are about 20min away to the east there is night out in the city and to the west a little bit of country ;)Considering our sports are nothing like UT or A&M we aren\\'t too bad.  There\\'s a lot going on from wheelchair basketball to mud volleyball! Lots of unique things in store and plenty of people involved.Some older buildings but they\\'ve done tons of renovations and new construction.Great restauraunts nearby only takes a few minutes to get toNo football team, basketball is the only thing we really hear about.Laptops at the library to check out for free, computer labs everywhere, printing almost everywhere, all up to date windows 7 and kept in working condition.College is kinda in the getto, there are saftey measures put in place though. Students are friendly, very diverse atmosphere.There are not too many parties at this college. Many of the clubs and bars are not close either. You have to drive a good distance to do pretty much anything.There are a lot of parking lots, but they fill up quickly. Also, many of the lots are pretty far from campus.The dorms are pretty great. There are three newer resident halls and even the older ones are kept up well. Plus, they are all close to the main part of the campus and the gym.The dining hall has a good variety of food available. Outside of the dining hall there are plenty of fast food places and restaurants to choose from as well as a mall.It can get sweltering in the Texas summer heat. The buildings are not too far away from each other tough so it makes up for it. Once summer passes it is great.I think Arlington is a nice city. I just don\\'t have much time or money to explore it.I have not noticed any drug behavior at my school. Although, this could be because I\\'m too busy studying to notice.I am just beginning the pursuit of my Master\\'s Degree at UTA and have been pleasantly surprised at the application process and how helpful the majority of the college has been at helping me acquire the information I need.I love how there are so many different majors offered in this school. It allows for people from all walks of life to mingle together and learn from each other.Arlington is considered the fun capital of north Texas, but beyond the big attractions, there ends up being not much to do except for pool halls.The film school at UTA is small and lovable. A few knowledgeable professors and a group of talented students make up the department but apparently it is the fastest growing one in the art school!There are an abundance of parking spaces, including ones that were just built, but the major deciding factor in whether you\\'ll have a spot is how early you decide to show up. The early bird gets the parking space!I havent seen any. The campus is even tobacco free.There is plenty of parking. It would be more effective use of space if they would build a large parking garage  that was open to general student parking. The majority of the campus is parking lots.Some old buildings. The Life science department needs an upgrade for sure. The labs are very outdated.I am a part of UTA\\'s Engineering program, which I thoroughly enjoy because there is a wide variety of programs and majors. Lots of options to choose from, and there are a lot of people in regards to faculty and staff that want you to succeed and will help you do that  to the best of their ability.UT Arlington has a VERY diverse student body. There are many different organizations, clubs, fraternities, etc. for whatever you\\'re interested in participating in.I don\\'t use the school transportation that much because I have my own car, but I know that there are buses that can take you around campus and to your parking lot if needed. If you get out of class late, you can always call a security escort to drop you off where you need to go around campus.There is the Connection CafÃ© which has a variety of food. Usually they try to change it up but still it can get boring to eat the same food there. There is also Panda Express, Pizza Hut, Chik-fil-A, Subway, Starbucks, a noodle house and a sushi place whose name escapes me where you can use your dining dollars.the cowboys and rangers are fairly close to school which is pretty coolonly 1 time that there has been an issue at school but  the problem wasnt even at schoolits usually pretty hot because its texas but besides that the hot, its not that badThe places around campus are good. I guess you get kind of tired of eating at dining halls, but when you need something to eat between classes, you can\\'t complainThe night life is amazing even if your under 21 you can still have lots of fun here at ut arlingtonMy major being business, was so much fun at first i thought I was going to be boring but it turned out ausomeThis school is amazing in curriculum registration and the workload isnt even that much..Housing Is the BEST â€“ Extremely helpful and very well informed and diverse, depending on your particular needsIt was pretty easy for me to get into the Aerospace program. The most important criteria of course is your GPA but it is not that hard to keep it up but one slip up and it can fall fast.The Aerospace program is great but there are a few teachers that are not that great and the math portion of the program is terrible. but overall it is a great program to be in.The weather in Arlington is okay. Other then the heat and rain every so often it is pretty niceThe campus has several places where students can eat even if they are on a meal plan. There are some great places that are off campus as well and are not to far from the campus. I knew people who were on meal plans and they enjoyed their food they had a buffet every day and several choices from healthy snacks and fruit as well. And if there is not enough time to eat there are vending machines and there is a store that you can go to and buy. You can also use your college I.D to pay for things as well (as long as there is money on the card). The campus is very good about food and saving money.I chose UTA because of their athletic training program. They are noticed for both kinesiology and engineering. The kinesiology program has a wide variety and the professors are helpful and are able to guide you I\\'m which classes would be best to take for an upcoming semester. They are hands on learning as well and are very informational in lectures. Depending on which department a student chooses in kinesiology there are sometimes limited spaces in certain classes because they fill up very fast. Whenever there is homework assigned study options include time with a TA or other places around campus. For kinesiology majors a popular study place is the Macericks Activity Center (MAC) or the library.The UTA campus is very safe. Security is there if there is a situation. Although we have had 2 incidents in the spring semester of 2013, they were immediately taken care of. I don\\'t feel uncomfortable when I walk around the campus, even at night. If there is anything that goes wrong the school is right on the case as soon as possible and inform others as well. It is very informative and helpful and it definitely helps everyone feel safe.The drug use at UTA is not a big issue. I have not seen anyone dealing any drugs or drinking. There might be a few people around the campus that might do drugs, but I have never heard about someone doing drugs or seen anyone doing drugs on campus. No one is ever peer pressured either.All of my classes are online. So long as I have an internet connection I can perform my work.I am attending the University of Texas at Arlington and i am very happy with the way classes are taught. the professors are cery committed to their subjects and are very knowledgeable. I chose Kinesiology as my major and it requires a lot of sciences. Recently while I was in the introduction class last semester it was very interesting and reading ahead was an important thing to understand the lecture. The labs were very helpful and we always had opportunities to get practice at different schools around the area. There was homework but not to much to where it became stressful. Also after completing the major courses practice hours can be anywhere as long as the professor is ok with the location of your choice. Some places include high school\\'s, middle schools, and even athletic training programs.I\\'m in the UTA Academic Partnership BSN program. The program is entirely online. You must be extremely disciplined as the workload is much greater than attending classes in person. The online modules with recorded lectures and study material are very helpful.Parking permits are VERY expensive for the parking lots you have access to. I was a commuter and must make sure I gave myself plenty of time to find a parking spot and most likely walk a long distance. Lots fill up quickly and they are all very far from the most accessed buildings.All of the town around campus is full of every restaurant imaginable with every kind of option. It is a very diverse city therefore has options for everyone.I am an accounting major, it is one of the hardest majors to earn. Continual studying and homework nightly to stay on top of what you\\'re learning. But, an excellent set of professors and business school to help you succeed.Continual campus security and police officers, surveillance videos, and help towers all around campus. No firearms and no alcohol and tobacco to help keep campus safer.The campus has general rules and regulations, keeping firearms off campus, no alcohol or tobacco, and an honor policy for cheating, etc.There are many different departments and offices to help you with Financial Aid, FAFSA, scholarships, loans, and grants. There are monthly postings of available scholarships in the office and you can always discuss financial aid with an adviser or worker at the office. However, finding and applying for scholarships is your responsibility, but you have more than enough resources for help.Based on your meal plan, you can use Dining Dollars to eat at one of the many restaurants and fast food places on campus or in the area. Just about everywhere you go, there is a place to eat that is not part of the cafeteria.We have about 32,000 students, 367 organizations including fraternities and sororities, seven different residence halls with free laundry/TV/wi-fi, people are highly social. We have multiple various opportunities for help with housing, on-campus jobs, employment with your degree as you work for it, internships, you can study abroad, there are peer mentoring groups, student congress, and despite the active lifestyle, everyone is peaceful and focused on academics.UT Arlington\\'s basketball team is much better than any in the DFW metroplex, and school spirit and morale is abundant all over the school. Students are highly involved, with 367 organizations to choose from. Furthermore, athletic activity does not deprive or distract students from being focused academically on their degree. There are also training and exercise facilities. Personally, I have not yet begun to live at the university, so I do not know of the quality of equipment, but the students and staff talk about it with much enthusiasm.As far as I know there virtually is no drug scene at UT Arlington, so much so that I don\\'t believe alcohol is even permitted at house parties. Though I do believe the possible drug scene heavily depends on who you spend your time with but as a whole there really isn\\'t one on campus.Night life is pretty good. Throughout the semester there are numerous activities that both students and guests can attend. There really aren\\'t a lot of house parties and alcohol isn\\'t really allowed at the house parties that do take place.We have several extremely high ranked club sports and the athletic facilities are amazing. We have this very large athletic club area called the MAC that is free to all currently enrolled students. The MAC quite literally has every exercise machine you could possibly think of. Also at the fast majority of club meets there is always a heavy fan base of students present.There are numerous different types races and religious groups on the campus, but what\\'s so nice about that is that no one particular group is held higher or put on a pedestal. The school is really all inclusive.I love Arlington because I have lived here my whole life. The area around UTA is really growing and becoming like it\\'s own little town. The restaurant and bar options are growing and more places are available to us to live in as well. Plus, the close proximity to Dallas and Fort Worth is great for when we want to do something different!Finding an internship was much easier than I expected. Because the Business School puts on a job fair each semester and provide amble opportunities to prepare, the process went really well. As a marketing major, I was offered several internship opportunities before making my final decision. I got great pay and wonderful experience during my time as an intern this summer. I just wish more people took advantage of the job fair. Business students really do have the upper hand in this situation because we constantly hear about and are preparing for it.There are lots of parking spots on campus. Because I take morning classes, I never have trouble finding a good spot. When I get out of class in the afternoon, there are almost no spots open for those just now coming to class.Lots of accessibility in many areas on campus. The connection is good and there are always helpful people around to troubleshoot any problems you may have. The Wifi is nice and I usually don\\'t have any problem using my laptop on campus.Lots of students are involved but we need more spirit to support the teams.There is transportation to go all around the campus, yet there is no transportation from other near by cities like Fort Worth for those that do not drive  yet.I hope to take my Visual Communications major and go into non profit advirtisment. Freelancing all the way, of course!At UTA there at all types of people. This is the most diverse campus I have ever seen. When you arrive you wonder how all of these people get along but then the longer you are there the more you feel and see the joy UTA brings to all of these people. It is like it brings all of these random people together just because the ones who dont\\'t fit any where else fit here.This school is located by many restaurants. Many are even in walking distant. The number of after school activities offered by the clubs here are unfathomable. There\\'s almost always an event you could attend each day.After review many professors online, I\\'ve come to a conclusion that many of the professors are quite difficult, but all in all, they do prepare us for the future. You learn everything you need to know for the exams as long as your pay attention. Registration was a long process due to the many applicants, but there are many people who will share a common major as you so finding study groups are quite easy. This school offers many after school tutoring programs as well. Your understanding and success in this school is their number one priority.I have yet to attend this school, but I\\'ve had over 20 family members attend this school themselves. I\\'ve learned the workload is pretty high, but you learn a lot. There are plenty of job opportunities on campus as well, and programs offered are excellent.The school is relatively clean. The social atmosphere is great. There\\'s always new people you can meet and a lot of friendly people. The cost of tuition isn\\'t too high either. It\\'s located near lots of small restaurants practically in walking distance.A melting pot of colorful characters and intriguing personalities, UTA is a school to be imitated when it comes to incorporating a diverse student body into its campus. African-Americans, Asians, Whites, Middle Easterners, and Indian transfer students all occupy the same space, not to mention the variety of religions that the aforementioned students adhere to. The only shortcoming is that the different groups tend to keep to their own interests and majors, limiting interaction between people.Not much of a nightlife. Homecoming seems to be the only social event of the schoolBecause I feel like the buildings aren\\'t super close, weather should result in a little bit of leniency for classes.Because it\\'s still hugely a commuter school, there isn\\'t a lot of student life after hoursThe dorms a really nice and clean.  Yeah, they are quite expensive, but your getting every bit of your moneys worth at the dorms at UTA!They will go above and beyond to help you with whatever you need...and I love that!This college has a decent/tolerable level of strictness.  I don\\'t have a problem with it at all.UTA is very diverse. It has students from more than 61 countries attending the school. Everyone and their culture is accepted. We even have international week where the different culture clubs can show off their country of origin.Greek life is apart of UTA, but it does not dominate the social scene of the campus. Students can attend frat parties, but you don\\'t feel left out if you don\\'t attend.I feel very safe here. The campus police are always around and just make everyone feel safe. There are several emergency call centers for students in emergency cases. Its a small environment that just makes everyone feel at home. Still lock your doors and hide your belongings.The facilities here at the University of Texas - Arlington are absolutely amazing. Everything is fairly new and they look so nice. The athletic center or MAC is amazing, a great place to hang out and excellent work out facility. The library has multiple floors to study at and tons of computers to use. The University Center is cool place to visit and has a billiards and bowling alley to hang out and have fun.Public transportation is fairly easy around Arlington. There are buses to help you get around and a lot of things are in walking distance. Transportation is just very accessible here.The new event center is amazing! The MAC, (Maverick Activities Center), is a great place to hang out, study, and work out. It even has a mini convenience store, it practically has everything in one place, except a room to sleep in. The facilities are fairly new and look amazing. Everyone here is so friendly and making friends is so easy. I went to the University of Houston last year and this school completely surpasses my pass university. I love it!Greek life is pretty average. People aren\\'t really stuck up about being in a frat so the parties are cool too.The dorms are pretty diverse and walking around campus you will see every race so it\\'s pretty normal. People are not isolated because of ethnicity.I love my Academic Partnership. I am able to complete all coursework online while working full time as a teacher and taking care of my family.I found the process quite easy. They have admission specialists who walk you through each and every step, making sure you have all the correct paperwork filled out. The only challenge I faced was getting my GRE scores to them. I took the GRE in the 90\\'s and apparently the year I took it, the scores were only reportable for 5 years. I had to drive to the school (1.5 hours away) and take my original score report. It was a miracle I still had it after all these years.Ive never had an internship! But im pretty sure they would be greatIts pretty good. I enjoy it because it is my passion.I just wish there were so many conditions to entering the college. I am happy with it, there are some great teachers. My goals are solely to finish school with great grades. My concern about finding a job is the salary and how unexperienced Id be at it.As far as transportation at UT Arlington I really cannot speak on. I have a car, I used to use the shuttles but they would always be late so I stopped.Texas weather is University of Texas at Arlington weather so I would say it is unpredictable and that is unfortunate. My allergies are extreme in the spring, Winters are fairly reasonable but people from Texas cannot drive in inclement weather including rain. Fall is perfect here.I am a psychology major and it is fairly easy for me. I suppose the reasoning behind this is because I think about things in a very objective way and you need to be objective as a counselor which is what my goal is to be.The academic opportunities offered at the University of Texas at Arlington are endless. You can major and minor in numerous subjects. There are numerous professors that you can choose from and as far as registering for your classes you can choose morning classes, evening classes, or even online courses. Most students use a combination of both. I am a psychology major and I have one year left to get my bachelors.The Modern Languages Department is great. You get to know your professors very well and they are easy going as well. They are strict and demanding but very easy people to talk to. It is a very small community allowing for you to get to know practically all the students in the Modern Languages Department.UTA campus life is awesome. They have a little bit of everything. The clubs and greek life of so diverse and fun. Also the food, is excellent a lot of choices.UTA gave me the money I needed and I am happy with the process because it is easy. Just fill the FAFSA out and submit and they take care of everything else. The maverick promise grant for those with family income less than $60,000 ends up paying for 85% of tuition. The rest you can pay with scholarships, and maybe end up getting a refund. You may not have to pay a dime and end up getting paid to go to school.I really wish there was public transportation! Arlington has no buses, hardly any sidewalks, bike lanes are few and in between. You wont be getting around much if you don\\'t have a car of your own or catch a ride with friends, walking can only get you so far..Campus dining is great. There is a variety of food options and there\\'s also healthy choices.Athletics are amazing here. You will never be bored at this campus.It\\'s hard to find parking in the middle of the day. You have to arrive early just to park in a good spot.Love this school. There are resources everywhere and the teachers are willing to help.UTA is very nice actually. I went there for 1 semester and plan to go back in a bit after some classes I\\'m finishing and I\\'ve never seen anything wrong t all. The environment is clean and good, you don\\'t feel odd anywhere on campus. Everyone has there own worries.The area around campus is growing and it is easy to find chain restaurants, as well as, some family owned restaurants. Chipotle, freebirds, panera, are among my favorites around campus. There is many more though.As a day student I feel safe walking around the campus. However, if I had classes that ended in the evening then I would feel less safe walking to my car and class. Also, being a male, I feel that I am less likely a target then my fellow female students. The campus is nice but the surrounding area of central Arlington has some neighborhoods that definitely have a higher crime rate then where I live. The security alert system sends out emails and texts when there is a threat on campus and it is great system.The Central Library is an awesome resource. However, the science education center, which is a computer lab I frequent, needs some major upgrades when it comes to printing and computer space. But mostly the printing there is frustrating. It is worth it to walk to the library to find a computer and print off documents there.Buses come by every 20 - 30 minutes, there are scheduled intervals but the buses are normally early or late, which makes waiting for them a gamble and it is always quicker to walk to class. Late night transportation is good, call the police office and they will have a golf cart come pick you up and take you to where you need to go on campus.Great Nursing program, one of the best in the country.There is a wide variety of people here, being in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, with everyone from kids straight from high school, older student returning to college, international students and transfer students! Looks range all over the board!The computers labs are easily accessible and user-friendly.On campus transport is wonderful and the DART bus line recently extended their reach to the UTA campus, so it is connected to the entire metroplex!Sometimes it feels like there really isn\\'t much of a social life available for students not in a frat or sorority. Sure, if you leave campus, but there are not many school organizations as popular as the Greeks. However, there is still a large percentage of non-Greek students, so even if Greek life isn\\'t for you there\\'s still plenty of friends to hang out with!Most people assume the students who go to UTA are either rich white kids or lower class African Americans. But that\\'s definitely not the case. Arlington is such a diverse community that it shows on campus.Honestly, the dorm life at UTA isn\\'t that great for underclassmen. However, the on-campus apartments are newly renovated and incredible. They are clean, spacious and affordable.The sun is always shining on our campus! Summer lasts until November, and then we enjoy two wonderful weeks of Autumn before it turns blistery cold for Winter. It never gets cold enough to snow, though.It is a safe place, just do not wander alone at night.Music Education is FANTASTIC at UTA. The music program is growing and gaining strength consistently. We have excellent faculty that devote a lot of time and study to improving your experience as a music student. If I have one tip to say to a future music student is:rnrnGet to know your professors!!! They will write your recommendation letters, help you tutor you (music theory, ear training, music history), and they LOVE to help you get better at whatever subject they teach.rnrnWe have incredibly faculty!Permits are too expensive, dorms don\\'t have enough spaces, typically lots are too far away from buildings. You don\\'t need a car to get across campus, it\\'s much less efficient.rnrnIt\\'s incredibly difficult to find a parking space within an ample amount of time if you are a commuter, because everyone commutes. rnrnThe Parking Garage is shared with the church across the street, and is typically too inconvenient to use. Lots of money was spent on trying to improve the parking situation, but little to no progress has been made.rnrnBeware, However, if you park anywhere incorrectly or improperly (or even sometimes correctly) you will get a fine very quickly.Campus is very safe. I have walked alone at night, and there is almost nothing that is relatively dangerous. Other than perhaps Doug Russell park, which I don\\'t recommend walking in at night.rnrnCampus police works wonders when an emergency is spotted. Sometimes maybe even in an exaggerated sense. In the dormitories \"emergencies\" are spotted regularly and people are evacuated because someone burned popcorn. However this is better than the opposite: A lack of communication.rnrnThe communication the police department has is fantastic. Mymav alerts work quickly and efficiently when there are potential dangers. Escorts are typically available and arrive within a decent window of time.rnrnYes improvements could definitely be made, but in general campus is very safe.At UTA ethnicity diversity is great. There is a different ethnicity in almost every corner. We have predominantly white population, but it\\'s almost unnoticeable due to the amount of diverse cultures and backgrounds you can find on campus. Economic background is also diverse. There are some financial extremes, such as high spenders and people with very low financial resources. For the most part the majority is middle class to low. As far as political beliefs, the school has a strong mix of conservatives and liberals. Just like with economic background, there are extremes, but most fall in the middle. Lastly, (although I am not part of it) I have heard we have a pretty awesome LGBT community.The dorms are geared towards everyone.  There is a diverse atmosphere.  Everything is accessible to the dorms.  Everything is within walking distance.Being an international business major at UTA is more or less like being two different majors. You\\'re being double dipped. Half in a foreign language program and half in a normal business program. There\\'s the obvious business implication but then you\\'re being exposed to a completely different culture.It\\'s texas so the weather can be very volatile at times. Hot one day cold the next in repetition can be really annoying especially when you thought it was time to put away your big heavy coat one week when its been 80 degrees only for that one last cold front to come through and change the game once again.There\\'s a wealth of degree programs available especially in the math and sciences but there are a lot of opportunities especially in cultural focuses that are being missed by the school.There is no public transportation besides the campus shuttle, which helps a lot but you have to keep up with the times. Late at night the campus police is always available as well as the golf cart people!There are more newly built residence halls that overly exceed expectations of the typical \"dorm room\". The older buildings, however, do need improvements. All of the residence halls are close enough to campus and all classes. Walking is not an issue.There is a large variety of majors including ones that can be taken solely online. I love UTA as well as the professors and courses.There\\'s plenty of security escorts at UT-Arlington. Crime still happens, but it\\'s at a small rate.UT Arlington just finished building a new dorm and a new strip of restaurants with plenty of variety. There\\'s a sport\\'s grill, a Mediterranean restaurant, Vietnamese restaurant, a sandwich shop, a frozen yogurt shop all on that strip! The prices are a little high for me, but I\\'m cheap. Nothing unreasonable though.The clubs in Arlington aren\\'t bad. However, you could save yourself money and go to an equally fun house party(especially if you\\'re underage). On the plus side, if you get bored in Arlington, there\\'s always a nightclub to go to in Dallas.Honestly, Texas weather in general is bipolar so you never know what to expect. From my experience, North Texas has a little more variety than my hometown in Central Texas. Sometimes, in the winter, it will snow in the morning so be prepared. Then the next day, the sun will be shining like nothing happened the day before. Just be prepared for all four seasons of the year in one week.So far, all of the instructors I\\'ve had for my major have been really nice and understanding. Because there are so few Communication Technology majors at UTA, it makes it easier to connect with them and ask them questions, as opposed to a lot of the more popular majors.As a communication technology major, it\\'s difficult to find class times to accommodate being able to work and go to school. There are so few of us that they only offer one class time per class. But despite that, I definitely wouldn\\'t change my major. I love web design, and I aim to be successful at it and make it a career. I have no concerns being able to find a job as a web designer, as long as I keep my grades up and get internships along the way.As a communication technology major, an internship is pretty much a must if I want to get into the field. I do indeed plan on getting an internship next summer - I\\'d say my dream internship would be at BNSF.It\\'s really hard to go to class when you\\'re just one in a million. UTA is such a huge campus and it\\'s really difficult to get one-on-one time with the professor. Not to mention all of the Campus Crime Bulletins they put out every two weeks or so. For example, one night at my work-study job, there were gunshots fired across the street! Needless to say, I\\'ll be trying harder next semester - I\\'m aiming for a 3.5!The amount of diversity at UTA is crazy - in a good way! I like that I am being exposed to a vast amount of different cultures rather than just one. I believe each person I encounter from a different culture provides a different viewpoint on life.Being a nursing major at UTA is definitely difficult but extremely worth it. When you first start as a pre-nursing major it seems like you are competing against hundreds of other girls for less than two hundred spots. Turns out you\\'re right, but along the way I have realized that this competition results in only the best making the cut. This means that once I do graduate from UTA, my alma mater will say a lot about how qualified I am as a nurse.The athletics at UTA were great at some points. The men\\'s basketball team did very well almost winning a conference championship again. The women\\'s team had a down year but they will be back. Track and Field did pretty well also and the baseball/softball teams had good seasons.UT Arlington has helpful resources for all students to succeedUTA is a commuter school that brings people from all corners of society. It is pretty diverse from what I see.The computer labs are not bad, but I wish we had a printing quota based on the fees we have paid instead of the pay as you go system currently established at the university!I don\\'t really hear about a huge drug scene on campus, so I might be in the minority on this topic.When someone enrolls, UTA should give more information about enrollment.It is excellent. The registration is well organized and neat.I like the parking except sometimes the parking gets full so quickly.I received a decent amount of money. However, I have gotten less money from the previous year. If you receive grants, you must be aware that they change yearly depending on your income and how much money they have. I would suggest to apply to as many scholarships as you can.Most of the food options are fast food. Some include: McDonalds, Wendy\\'s, KFC, Taco Bell. All of these are within 15 minutes walking distance and maybe less than 5 minutes in a car. A favored restaurant near UTA is Bethany\\'s. It is Asian food, like fried rice and chicken. You can also buy Boba.Parking is very bad here! Most of the parking spots have a big section just for faculty and staff and most of them are empty. If you dare park there you will receive a ticket. The nearest parking spots are always full! You would have to get there before 8 am to get a good parking spot.Arlington has many parks that include trails for biking and hiking. It is very stress relieving to take a walk every once in a while. Arlington also has Six Flags Over Texas, Hurricane Harbor, the Cowboys Stadium, and the Rangers Ballpark. It has much to offer. The atmosphere is very calm and there are many off campus locations that offer student discounts.Out of all my experiences at this university I\\'ve never had such a worse experience far as roommates. Sure enough the cops, and authorities at campus keep the external problems of campus, but what goes on, on the inside of dorms sometimes between rooms mates can horrid. I\\'ve had a total of three roommates: marijuana smokers, and drunks. Even though I specifically answered the housing survey denying I did neither one of these things I still got placed with said implications. which others gladly took part in. This campus needs checks to be made between the residents dorms.As the weather if often usubject to change just about anywhere due to human interaction or just the natural flow of mother nature the weather far as I recall was often stable. True enough there were cold nights, some unnecessary because of roommates were messing with the thermostat, or left the window open overnight, but there was nothing that truly affected my campus experience.Being a slightly picky eater I often found myself having to succumb to new things. The school did okay in serving a decent quality, I suppose (although it did get tiring, because one could expect the same thing periodically). In retrospect I appreciated how they remodeled the waffle station; it really showed to me they\\'re thinking of change, because first semester it was a wait, and if a mess between each person using the waffle iron. Secondly as the staff was generally nice, and the whole setup of the dinning I felt it could do more to bring out the potentially especially in the dinning meal plans.In all honesty being a freshman there\\'s alot of dorms at the University of Arlington that aren\\'t new; a general amount of them are slightly more shabbier than others depending what side you decide to live on. My freshman year I stayed in the oldest, yet cheapest place on the lot (ie. Brazos). The social life was better than the last dorm I previously moved in from. The RAs were thorough, they tried to get students involved, but in all the architecture f the building was somewhat horrid. I lived on the fourth floor and carrying stacks of dorm room supplies back, and forth can be a hassle next to having to dodge the pipes running out the walls. While the lighting was fairly well unlike some of the more expensive dorms, far as amenities, and bug control there wasn\\'t any issues.Computer labs are always busy during finals times, but that is to be expected anywhere.  The reason I give the grade a b, is that during these times the speed of which the WIFI acts really slows down and can make work frustrating.There\\'s a large variety of majors to choose from at UTA. You\\'ll will find your match no doubt and succeed with all the help UTA offers.The nightlife at UTA is good. There\\'s always something to do and some places don\\'t close until 2 every night.The crime on campus is definitely taken care of by the campus police. I feel safe walking by myself on campus.I love living on campus. I was hardly ever late to class and I didn\\'t have to worry about parking. Everyone was real friendly and I met so many people. The rooms were comfortable and it was a reasonable price. I\\'m going to miss living on campus.Parking on campus is a challenge.  It is difficult to find parking close to class.  Be prepared to walk 10 or more minutes to class.  On campus housing is a 5 to 10 minute walk to class, while off campus housing requires a car as there is no public transportation. A parking permit for the Spring and both Summer sessions cost $95.  Campus police are constantly checking cars for permits and parking violations.New, small restaurants have been built on campus, but eating places outside of campus are pretty bland and boring. Within a 5 mile radius of UTA, we have a few chicken places, a taco bell, chipotle, and of course, a McDonald\\'s.I always have to ask for extra funds because the amount I\\'m awarded is never enough to cover my classes, not including books. Getting through to the financial aid office is also a difficult task. The phone lines are always busy and the wait time can be as long as 45 minutes.I see a lot of Greek life booths and set ups, but they aren\\'t really active, otherwise. I dont see a lot of partying going on at UTA.Campus food is only good for the first semester but Arlington has tons of places you can dineAt UTA, the academia is amazing. The classes are great but very challenging. They make you work for your degree, one you have be proud of when you finish.UTA is great! Though the campus is local they still uphold the university to a tier 1 status.Arlington is the mecca of entertainment. Along with the university, it has Six Flags Over Texas, Texas Rangers ballpark, Dallas Cowboys Stadium, and Six Flags Hurricane harbor. With Dallas only 25 minutes away, the students have alot of activities to fill up their free timeIt\\'s a college campus, so obviously drugs and alcohol are present. However, there are rarely arrests on campus for possession charges and the occasional ticket for alcohol on campus is written during a weekend party. UTA is technically a tobacco free campus, but people can be found smoking in dark alleys with little consequence. All in all, drugs and alcohol are not really a problem, except in rare instances.The computers have up to date hardware, and Windows 7 is stable enough to work on all of the units. The internet connection speeds are great, and WiFi is available inside all buildings, and within approximately 50 feet outside buildings. Even at peak times there are usually computers available, although sometimes it can be a hassle to wait for someone that is clearly using the computer for recreational use, rather than school or professional work.As a double major in Criminal Justice and German language I find myself looking at dozens of options as far as advising help goes. All of my professors have experience in the fields that they are teaching about, and many of my German instructors are German born, making the learning experience that much more realistic.After studying Biomedical Engineering my first two semesters, I decided to change my direction, double majoring in Criminal Justice and German Language in the hopes of getting a job in the federal government (CIA, FBI, ATF, etc). I loved the engineering classes, they were very hands on and engaging, but I realized that I wanted to do something more adventurous than research. I have only received what appears to be computer-generated responses from the CIA, which can be frustrating, but the career center is helping me get more information as I go through the semesters.Except for the occasional flash flood in the spring semester, North Texas weather is relatively stable. The temperature can fluctuate 30 degrees from day to day, but other than that there are relatively few occasions where inclement weather affects the operation of the school.One thing that UTA has going for it, is its diverse population of students. Many of the clubs, groups, and organizations, represent many of the different kinds of students who attend UTA. I still remember how at freshman orientation, one of the major topics covered was promoting diversity and acceptance.There is a wide variety of off-campus housing to choose from at UTA. It is relatively easy to sign up, and some of the leases offered are flexible. However, a lot of them can be quite expensive.I\\'m currently majoring in Accounting at UTA. Accounting can be a pretty difficult major, and the workload can be stressful. However the curriculum is pretty straightforward, it\\'s just a lot to learn/remember. The college of business does offer tutoring opportunities for those that require them, but the tutoring offered for upper level classes isn\\'t free. The Accounting director does email links to various accounting internship/job opportunities through affiliates of UTA.As far as UTA\\'s student life is concerned, there is definitely room for improvement. The University Center is in desperate need of renovation. With the amount of students that attend UTA on a regular basis, the University Center seems small and easily becomes very crowded. The Maverick Activity Center (UTA\\'s athletic center) offers great services/facilities, but is located on a very inconvenient part of campus, where parking is extremely difficult to find. With the majority of students being commuters, and with the fast-paced nature of classes, the best way to meet people make friends is by joining clubs at UTA. UTA does offer a variety of clubs, but you have to make the effort to inquire at places like the University Center, and keep and eye out for their activities on campus. The clubs and activities on campus, are welcoming but not as accommodating for commuter students.For the most part, the professors are pretty reasonable. The majority that I\\'ve encountered are available outside of class, and have been willing to answer any questions that I\\'ve had about the course material. As I\\'ve gone further into my major, the workload has picked up, and being able to properly manage my time has become very important. The average amount of classes that I\\'ve taken each semester at UTA is five. The various exams that I\\'ll have to take during a semester tend to occur around the same time, either during the same day, or within days of each other. In order to register for classes, you have to meet with an academic adviser for your (intended) major. It is very important to sign up as early as possible. The classes of favored professors are quickly fill up, so the sooner you sign up the better.80 percent of the students commute to school. Many of the students that one will are returning to college to continue their education. The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) is very diverse in regards to both the various ethnicities and age groups of the University\\'s students. However, because the majority of students at UTA are commuters, it can be somewhat difficult to connect with other students and make friends. Also, school spirit is something that is lacking at UTA. Although some of the students are able to rally support for some of the other sports such as basketball, the lack of a football team reduces the presence of school spirit.The drug scene isn\\'t a big issue. The only thing that needs more enforcement is the smoking around campus, but besides that everything else is relatively nonexistent.The guys and girls at UTA are pretty unique. There are so many different kinds of people with different cultures, styles, and interests. I really haven\\'t seen or met anyone with huge egos so I can just simply say that UTA is a chill campus and is certainly more appealing than what I orginally thought. I\\'m glad I picked this school.I don\\'t live on campus but it looks good from the outside i\\'ve visited one of the rooms and i loved it!There\\'s always some meeting or event where free or heavily discounted food is served. The organizers of these events are very good at getting the word out via student email or flyers/signs around campus.For the most part the campus is well kept and some of the new facilities are amazing especially the new engineering building but there\\'s a significant disparity between the old and the new. I wish they would bring some of the older buildings up to par.I am not a part of Greek life at UTA, however almost all of my friends are in a sorority or a fraternity. All of my friends who are a part of Greek life are wonderful people! They are very caring and studious! They can manage their time well, and most of them also have a job. They market their philanthropy very well so the non-Greek students know how they are impacting the community! I would say that non-Greeks don\\'t view Greeks as any different! I know Greek housing is available but I don\\'t know any specific details about Greek housing because I am not a part of Greek life.I tend to focus more on my academics than on varsity sports, but I have been to a handful of varsity games! The teams are very energetic and try to build up crowd enthusiasm, which does work! I am a member in UTA\\'s club tennis team and almost 100 people are a part of or are interested in joining club tennis! Club tennis definitely shows school spirit wherever we go! We make the Maverick name known wherever we go! We practice hard and compete hard! We are a close team! The UTA varsity tennis team has helped with club tennis drills in the past and they always encourage people to come out to the tennis matches! Students at UTA are working on our school spirit!UTA is the best school in the world. UTA is so diverse that it is a representation of the world. I\\'ve met countless people who just moved to America a week before school started! Everyone is so friendly regardless of where they grew up, what language they speak, and what culture they come from. The culture at UTA is so unique that it can\\'t be found anywhere else! Everyone has such a passion to succeed and thrive in their desired area of expertise! Becoming a Maverick has been the best decision of my entire life! I couldn\\'t picture myself at any other college or university. I\\'ve made lifelong friends that I couldnt image living without! Everyone at UTA is so welcoming and encouraging! I meet someone new every day! The Maverick way is the best way! Go Mavs!I am here for SLP and they have a good reviewAll the professors are passionate about their work and create a great learning atmosphere.I feel safe everywhere I goThe only bad part is on move in day there is a lot of cleaning to be done.There so many choices that fit all sorts of personalities.The athletic department is awesome because both campus and town are really involved. Flags go up,faces are painted, and overall just a great family friendly environment.I attend the University of Arkansas. The academics are great with professors who are understanding, passionate, and genuinely care about your success. In addition, they offer many diverse organizations to help you get connected and feel right at home.It is a great school with a diverse community.Probably the most diverse school I\\'ve ever seen.It\\'s definetly around, but that\\'s any college for you.I have so really small classes that require lots of presentations. Then I have few big classes, professors are more lecture lecture lecture.There are definetly better schools where a degree from there would be a lot better, but that being said its not a bad place to get your degree.The schools not in the greatest part of town, so you definitely have to look out.They look like decent dorms, but I live off campus as do most since this is a commuters college.I like that the fraternity\\'s are a lot more chill here then they are at other schools.We don\\'t have a football team, but if we did it would probably increase the school spirit toward athletics a lot.I love how friendly everyone is, and how easy it is to have fun here.There are so many different races, religions, ethnicities, and cultures of people at UTA. That\\'s actually one of things we\\'re known best for, being diverse. What\\'s great is that there\\'s a place for everyone, whether you choose to stick to your own kind, or if you prefer to mix it up, everyone can interect together without conflictUTA has a huge amount of scholarships. There are general admission scholarships for entering freshman and for transfer students, and there are a lot of scholarships within the departments. In engineering there are general engineering scholarships, but there are aslo some from each engineering discipline such as civil, mechanical, electrical, ect. The Honors College has a lot of funding available, including a full ride that covers tution, fees, books, housing, and meal plans. Though they have a lot available, UTA is very large and diverse so scholarships are very competitive.I wish there were more scholarship options that are not restricted based on first generation college students. I feel like too much is assumed just because you had one parent get a degree from college, hence, you are no longer eligible to apply for it. I am 30 now and still trying to complete school, having to pay for everything through loans and barely any grant or scholarship money.From what I hear, on-campus housing is suffice and is reasonable.The options are fine, but I typically buy food from the grocery stores to save money!I WOULD HAVE LIKE TO HAVE KNOWN THAT I EXHAUSTED MY UNDERGRADUATE FUNDING.I am not very social at my school. I love UTA campus, I think its beautiful. From what I do notice, UTA is extremely diverse. Black, white, asian, indian, females, males, gay, straight. You also have the art crowd, theater crowd, the jocks, the greek crowd, and the brains.Every bar I know about on Cooper street is basically a hole in the wall. My friends and I go to Dallas whenever we want to go out for a drink or to dance. If we want to go somewhere more low key we usually go to the Arlington highlands to an upscale bar.I received a decent amount of my financial aid but there was not that much after paying for classes and fee to go towards textbooks. Not that much money left over to save. I also do not like the fact that we only receive financial aid only a couple of day before school. Students need more time to purchase books, help with living expenses, and ultimately be more prepared for the upcoming semester.Fair. Teachers are very good though, for the most part.The computer labs are definitely are huge help especially when my own computer is acting up. Plus the labs have tons a resources like being able print out things and check out certain things.The academics overall are above average in terms of the curriculum given. I would rate it an A as many of the professors in various subjects are very well engaging and actually help you enrich your mind and inspire you to persevere in whatever major you are in. In terms of workload, if a college student is aspiring for the minimal amount, then this is the wrong school as many professors expect you to complete work outside of class as practice. The facilities are decent on campus.The athletic facilities are newly constructed and very much world class. However, campus support for the professional college teams such as basketball is not as celebrated compared to other universities. Team performance for the sports are average as well.Everyone at the school are pretty nice . If they know that you are new they will go out their way to make you feel accepted and comfortable. Most of them are really carefree and just worried about their grades so they are really smart but at the same time they know how to have fun.I dont really see anybody that is using drugs and if they are then they hide it really good.Everything has been newly remodeled with a new MAC center for UTA students as well as a massive 6 story library that allows students to check out from UTA as well as neighboring Arlington libraries.Definitely a nice campus will various resources, the library is open 24 hours during the week of finals. Also the lounges offer plenty of seating spaces as well as quiet places for studying.Never can tell with Texas weather one day it will be sunny the next it will be thunderstorms and the next day you will have a 20 degree temperature drop. In the spring and summertime the heat picks up it can make those walks to class feel like eternity.If you may or may not know Texas weather is bipolar. One day it could be really hot and the next day cold and windy. Another day it could be nice outside and in a matter of hours it can be raining cats and dogs. Just be prepared for Texas weather.The dorms are good. I live in Vandergriff which are the newest dorms that opened in the Fall of 2012. The other dorms are nice and there are a variety of styles.Many students commute to school so this isn\\'t set up like a tradition university. There isn\\'t as much activities, clubs, or parties. Most students however feel as if education is very important. The guys are a variety of mixes and the girls (including my girlfriend) are pretty hot.All of my professors have been very knowledgeable. I have learn a lot in the past year and I feel really excited about my future education here. I feel very comfortable with the workload, because the way it is presented is usually in a straightforward, easy to understand way.Our campus is a tobacco free campus. I don\\'t ever see any illegal activity on campus.The greek life isn\\'t so big here. They are always out on campus selling things but they all seem to stay to themselves.There are several different groups of restaurants right around campus. A longer drive will provide more. The restaurant range from cheap, American fast-food to expensive, authentic, international food. Many local places around campus provide student discounts and it\\'s not difficult to find coupons or deals at other stores.There are many things to do in Arlington as well as taking a 30 minute drive to several neighboring cities like Dallas or Ft. Worth. There are activities, entertainment, and shopping for any race, age, or economic background. Crime in Arlington alone isn\\'t bad. The main drawback, though, is the lack of public transportation. If you want to get anywhere, you have to drive yourself, get a cab, or walk (which isn\\'t easy).The drug scene at UTA is non-existent. If you want to party, UTA is not the place for you. All the students are very focused on their education, so even drinking isn\\'t very popular.I think the program is pretty good. I would do it over again if I could because I feel more prepared to enter the nursing field after my experience in school. My goal is to continue my education and become a nurse practitioner, and I see myself attending UTA for my MSN.Getting into the nursing program at UTA is pretty difficult because it is competitive. There are a lot of students that want to get accepted and your pre-nursing grades influence your acceptance. You must make A\\'s and have a minimum of 2 B\\'s in your major sciences in order to get accepted. It sounds tough, but if you manage your time and stay on top of things, it\\'s not impossible. I would recommend studying for the entrance HESI by doing lots of practice questions. That will help you increase your chance of getting accepted.I like the nursing program at UTA. It\\'s really hard to get in because it\\'s pretty competitive, but UTACON has excellent professors that know what they\\'re talking about! I really like the school because I feel like it has prepared me to become a good nurse. I know what to expect when I graduate. The workload is overwhelming at times, but time management is key to stay on top of things. Good luck!The parking attendants are really strict, make sure you get a parking pass!Lots of options, some of the bars are a little sketchyFew and far between and the due dates are super early.My major is sociology  and the reason I\\'m giving it a B+ is because the advisor for sociology is horrible you really have to take initiative and look at the undergraduate student catalog and know for yourself what classes you need to take. The advisor has had students taking classes they didn\\'t need and forgetting to tell students about a class they did need which sucks because some of them were about to graduate. I was fortunate enough to know a guy who is a sociology major and he planned out my whole schedule for me and told me what I need to take and who to take and who not to take because he in may will be a grad student. Overall I love my major the teachers are excellent they really know what they are talking about and the classes so far have not been dull. I\\'m excited to take sociology of religion in the fall and the Latina experience. My major offers a variety of different courses for you to take and explore.I actually don\\'t stay in an off campus apartment but from what I heard stay away from centennial court and maverick place apartments. The crime is horrible, the staff are incompetent and don\\'t care about the residents. Their is filth and trash everywhere. If your shower isn\\'t working or you put in a work order good luck trying to get the repair person to come out at a decent time to fix the situation. People have had their bikes stolen..cars etc overall these apartments are not where you want to be stuck in a lease and contract at I would suggest paying more money for a better apartment life at campus edge or midtown uta. The only good thing about the apartments I mentioned are that they are near the campus and parking isn\\'t an issue at the apartments. I gave it a B+ rating because their are a ton of apartments and I can\\'t grade all based off the bad apartments.The saftey is really outstanding on campus we constantly have cops driving around on the actual walkways on campus throughout the whole day. Arlington police and school police are always in the area surrounding the school and also we have a police office right across the street from the campus built in next to the vandergriff dorms and parking garages. They are right near the new school restaraunts also. Their are emergency call phones and buttons around campus so theirs really not much of a saftey concern to me and when something does occur police put out flyers and email students to alert them of current events. I would still recommend protecting yourself and your assets. So lock your doors don\\'t walk around late at night by yourself. Walk in big groups with people you trust etcThe main reason I came to UT Arlington was because the school really does care about the students. They work hard to provide us with entertainment such as drake, Rick Ross, etc every year. They offer various type of living and housing options and the option to have a meal plan to access the cafe and fast food places. Most of the students who do I tern ships their senior year and if they do good get the job right off the back with no problem. UT is a top nursing school and 95% of the nurses get a job at a hospital or medical center. The environement and atmosphere is laid back and chill..overall Ut is a great school.The weather is also so up in the air (no pun intended) when it comes to Texas. It is hot one day and cold the next. It makes it hard to attend events because you don\\'t always dress properly for them or they may be postponed due to unforseen circumstances.There is a huge amount of diversity at UTA. Different cultures all over campus.You can go to just about anything you want. Arlington has any kind of food. Best burgers..... Airway burgers across from Cowboys Stadium on Collins.It\\'s improving every year, but it had such a late start that is expected. Basketball games are fun!I felt like all the professors had a great knowledge of the subjects.I received some nice scholarships from the school. It was an easy process.I got quality education. Also felt prepared for when I got into the real world.There are computers but it is much easier to just bring your own. Sometimes it is hard to connect with WiFi but nicer than not having a computer.It is hard to get financial aid unless you are not white and not a woman.Safety in the campus is everywhere. Wherever you go, you will feel safe.The drug scene at UTA is not really big here. It can also depend on those who you hang out with that does drugs. Alcohol is a big thing on campus and many students take part in that during social scenes.UTA is very diverse when it comes to the ethnic diversity. You can see many different races while walking the campus.When there are home games for the athletes, a lot of students show their appreciation for the teams. They make sure that they show every way they can support, simply by dressing up in spirit wear, making posters, and giving away prizes to the audience. I really like how much school spirit there is on campus.UTA will send you text messages and emails of any issues on the campus.  They send periodic tests as well to make sure the system is functioning properly.UTA is an extememly divere university.  Many countries are represented in the different colleges.  UTA also provided continuing education for those learning English.Arlington is a great town.  Many activities such as the Rangers, the Cowboys and Six Flags.  Good restaurants.  UTA is a safe and beautiful campus.  Located between Dallas and Ft. Worth.Very satisfied with my course and will definitely do it again.The only challenge i think is having to take elective courses that don\\'t count towards my major ( I am an engineering major, and i have to to take music!!)rnAs an international student, i had to have good SAT\\'s and TOEFL results! lol..no abnormal application processIt keeps me engaged when am less busy, it makes me meet new people, it improves my leadership skills and it also improves my teamwork skillsThe teachers send out job posts and opportunities. The school helps you find scholarships. WOrkload is not overwhelming, but prepares you well. Everything is close. Parkinglots get full fast, but there is a garage you can pay extra if youare running late.Safety is something to keep in mind wherever you go. There are a lot of houses for rent within walking distance of the school.I feel there is a good sports scene.  Could be improved by involving students in contests or promotions.Students have been robbed and injured while attending classes.The Arlington hall RA\\'s are a bunch of kids put in charge to do an adults job. Had a horrible experience with the girls above me on the second floor and me and my roommate complained and followed rules yet we were penalized for everything. The girls just kept getting a slap on the wrist and we were being snobbed, rudely greeted from RA\\'s and ignored when calling to complain. I personally got tired of living underneath elephants so I moved to the third floor and my roommate moved to a different dorm hall. It\\'s Texas so it\\'s always nice unless it\\'s hellaciously HOT.Most people live throughout arlington and mansfield where housing is cheaper. The apartments closest to the school are terrible, however the new college park center is really nice, and the apartments on the west side of campus are okay.Traffic is really bad if you are a commuter studentMost dorms are housed by the freshman class. Most upper classmen tend to live in the on campus apartments or off campus.rnComing in as a freshman this year the dorm experience was pretty average.  I share a room and bathroom with one room mate and there\\'s always some kind of activity going on in our dorm lobby.  You get to meet a lot of people living in the dorm and you get a meal plan for on campus.There are computers all over campus that students have access to.rnAll you have to have is your student log in and password!We are getting more restaurants and things on campus. We do not have a football team so the school is highly involved with the basketball team, and other sports. We have a bowling alley and our gym is awesome! the library is great and the staff is very helpful.Arlington is a good town. There is a mall down the street and other shopping centers. We are like twenty minutes from both Dallas and Fort Worth, so there are things to do and plenty of places to eat. There is also six flags, hurricane harbor, Cowboy stadium and rangers stadium.Greek life is only 5% of the population. They are nice people and they have parties and stuff but it\\'s nothing special. There are houses they have but there are only so many rooms in each house.Freshman do not have to live in dorms. You can live where you want, youll have to apply of course but there is space.It\\'s TEXAS! The weather changes a lot. It can be cold one day and bright and shiny the next. But there is usally never any bad weather that will cause classes to be canceled.Some restaurants have no control over who will take what table or group of peoplegood amount of choices,buffet for a good price,and sometimes have fun late night food events(waffle party at 2am)New Apartments were just built and some even include utilities and fully furnished for a very fair priceYou have to arrive early to get a good spot and it it a long walkIf you want diversity, Uta is the place to be. There are a variety of peoples whom diversify the atmosphere here, and if you were to seek information about other people, you will find much to learn about our different races, religions, cultures, traditions, political beliefs, etc. However, Uta tends to overemphasize their \"diversity\" without noticing the impact it has onto their student body. Sometimes, it feels like Uta gives preferential treatment to self-segregating. Rather than actually unifying the student body, we present our diversity through the use of organizations and events specific to a certain minority, race, or ethnicity. Nonetheless, Uta is a source of attraction for those who want their college experience flavored with the interaction of ethnic and racial diversity.The cafeteria has good food every now and then but overall everything is okay. Another option is the plaza that has different foods like Chickfila, Subway, Panda Express, etc.Each department is different but so far every professor is helpful but some give a lot of work but studying on campus is easy. Department buildings have study areas and the library is 24 hours.Workload is heavy and some of the teachers are hard to understand but many students are helpful and most professors are very helpful also.Weather is never a factor here, driving to school is simple and if you live on campus it is not hard to get around in the cold or heat.Parking ticket will for sure be given to those who don\\'t have a parking permit. If you do then parking fills quickly through out the day but the farthest parking lot is in walking distance and some even have shuttles.The shuttles run all day. However, sometimes, they combine routes, which makes them run kind of slowly and off schedule. Also, some of the drivers drive really slowly and you come really close to being late for class.The campus has a strict underage policy about drinking, if you are caught you could be suspended from campus and the cops at UTA are actual Arlington PD so you could be arrested and charged. My best advice is to just wait till your 21 and then go to the local bars don\\'t drink underage!Athletics at UTA are a prime way to get involved in campus. The athletes are nice and caring and want people to come out and join. The team performance is generally great, we made it to nationals! School spirit can get a little crazy but its all in good fun!Are very proactive when comes to crime always touring campus and very active. It is beautiful at UTA and if you feel unsafe police will come and escort you to your vehicle or if you are looking to go to your dorm.Only about two good size computer labs, have to pay for printing (4 cents a page), wireless network is available all across campus but reliability can be a bit iffy. Would be best if you had your own laptop.Great local places right off campus, but if you want to find the more common restaurants it is about a 10-15 minute drive to the Highlands.The campus is tobacco free which is great...except that you will on ocassion see someone smoking.Security is top notch. You are never more than one minute from a police call booth and they are all very nice. However, we usually have maybe one mugging every two or three months, but the UTA department is usually pretty good about sending a notification for us to know to be careful and not walk around alone at night.Every off-campus housing in the immediate area of UTA is terrible and at least a million years old. The ONLY reason they are receiving a C+ rather than a triple F is because they just recently built a new complex called the Lofts which are actually extremely nice and high end set of apartments right next to campus. They are also very reasonably priced about $800 a month for a one bedroom and it\\'s very nice. If they renovated the deteriorating apartments it would be so much nicer.The safety and security on campus is high. There is a police department right near school, and there are emergency telephone post with a button that can easly be pushed through out campus. If a student feels unsafe, he or she can call a security golf car to come and drop him or her off for free to his or her destination area.The computer safety is high and the internet in the computers is fast. There are many places to use computers with a student identification and password. The computers are in good shape and have good software.The minimum experience I have with the financial aid department at UTA has been relatively painless.The counselors are very helpful in walking you through the processYes I do enjoy school. The reason is that it is online and very convenient.Yes, I am pretty happy with the program because I can do it online. This works well with my schedule. I plan to continue on to my masters in hospital administration.As a transfer student, there weren\\'t many scholarships from UTA that I qualify for. Come in with good grades is the best thing you can do.So far I am loving my science classes I am taking for the nursing prereq\\'s. So glad I switched from my previous IT major.I wouldn\\'t because one of the advisors is hard to deal with.One of the advisors is hard to deal with because she hardly does any work. But the classes aren\\'t that difficult. It\\'s not easy enough to slack off alot though.The process is pretty much just have enough hours,24, and you should be able to transition into your desired major. There\\'s also a GPA requirement of 2.25.Going to the connection cafe (buffet) gets old very fast. The options in the Plaza aren\\'t that great quality either. It\\'s hard to change it up for food, so I would rather buy groceries at Walmart or Kroger.Walking to class is nice if the weather\\'s decent. I hate to walk in the rain since I don\\'t like being wet, especially in class.Computers are accessible in the Library. Second floor is full of computers but be sure to get there early cause they sometimes do get occupied. There are other computers on the first, fourth, floors and some Halls have computer rooms, for example, Arlington Hall. Printing can be done in the library too and the programs are up to date.The financial aid process was always very confusing to me. My school year total was around 16 thousand, so it was pretty scary trying to meet deadlines for scholarships, take out loans, and all that to try to meet that money. Luckily, I had received a good amount of scholarships, so that helped greatly, but I still had to take out a loan, which you should be careful to check which type of loan you have to pay back with interest and which one is not. I am still a little confused over the whole process and it can sometimes get overwhelming, but as long as you are organized, have some kind of estimate of how much money you will be spending, and start applying for scholarships now, you should be good for when your next semester comes.The process to get into the Psychology major was relatively easy. I already had a bunch of college credits that I had earned in my high school so I didn\\'t really go through any special application besides them only putting me in Social Psychology, which is what I needed before I could take other higher level psychology classes. I had to get above a B in that class to be able to be eligible to enter the major\\'s advising network, which I did, but other than that, it went better than expected. Now I just have to keep my grades up to be able to maintain my spot in the program.There are a lot of fast food restaurants with in walking or 5 mins driving distance. Some even offer a UTA disscount if you show them your MAV ID (fast food places). Also you can always go near Parks Mall where restaurants like Razoos, Chilis, and many others surround it.Avoid Maple Square!!  I lived there for about three weeks and left because the place was absolutely infested with cockroaches.  You could really tell no one really gave a damn about maintenance or cleaning or extermination.  I also lived at Centennial Court for 9 months.  Thankfully, it did not have a bug problem, but the maintenance was still pretty shoddy.  Had cleanliness, water, and internet problems there.  The people at Centennial Court are rowdy and loud too.Beautiful weather, friendly people, new housing( and some old), lots of study spots.Knowledgeable professors who care about what they teach, invest in their students and help you out are here. You will find a variety of curriculum, and you can register according to what\\'s most fitting for you. There is plenty of academic help and advising.The music program is what made me decide to come here because it is different from other schools. It\\'s all the excellence in education you need, but instead of a cut-throat atmosphere there is a supportive community of students and staff who really enjoy each other. Instructors are very invested in their students, and the workload is reasonable. Some classes are hard, but we have all the help we need. In short, I love it.We don\\'t have a football team at all, but our focus is mainly on baseball and basketball. We have an awesome new facility, the College Park Center, where home basketball games take place, and the games are pretty fun!online professors were great about responding to questions in a timely  mannerTo be honest, I don\\'t think Greek Life is a big influence on campus. It exists and that\\'s pretty much it. I don\\'t think the Greek students are looked at negatively here.There are new restaurants popping up in the college park area that are pretty good but I\\'m hoping they will hurry and finish with the construction so we can have more options.UT Arlington has a fair amount of culture on campus. The student body is diverse and accepting of people of different cultural backgrounds and sexual orientation.being a biology major isn\\'t easy , there is hard work waiting for you but I do love and enjoy all the labs, I am better when working with my hands and seeing it instead of sitting in class or reading a fun experiment out of a book.pretty good and most of the teachers I have had so far were fun and awesome. much different than what you would get at high school. there is a whole other level of professionalism and it works with students!its good that there is rules to be followed although there are a few \"law breakers\" but whenever it is serious and students lives are in danger then the right and most discreet action is taken to take care of the situation.they are more pricy than colleges i have been to but they are very central and in the middle of all the action on campusI have never had to use the transportation system at school, but from speaking to fellow students that do use it daily, I know they do a good job of having many ways of assisting you. As well as the late night numbers you can call to have someone go and pick you up wherever you are and take you where needed, this is a great safety precaution.I received a good amount of financial aid, and it has usually been a pretty smooth process, I\\'ve never had to go in person to the office, sending in forms has been fairly simple.They can be kind of dirty since a lot of people use them. There are periods of time where they\\'re filled with people using them, and sometimes it\\'s frustrating when people use them for unnecessary things like facebook or youtube when others need it for school. The network reliability is average and the speed is average. Printing wasn\\'t very clearly explained and i had to have a friend explain to me how the system works. While it may be convenient to use your MAVID, i think alternate options such as using coins would be a much easier alternative for someone who needs a print on the go.There are a lot of opportunities, when I have a chance I will apply.Yes because there are opportunities here I did not know about until I enrolled. Plus they take care of their Science and Math majors- giving us the best toys.The application went very smoothly without a hitch.There are so many resources and help to get one through this weird thing called college life.The weather is wonderful.  It occasionally is cold and it has rained a few times but it\\'s usually nice outside. Makes it easier to get up and go to class.The campus is really nice.  It\\'s safe and the police keep people in line.Here in South Arlington, where I reside, are many things to get into. The new Cowboys Stadium, the Parks Mall, and many restaurants are very close to me. Shopping is never a hard task here. There are many shops and stores nearby as well. Just on the edge between Grand Prairie and Arlington are the Paragons. It is a new strip mall filled with great stores and food court.Most of the guys at UTA are sweet gentlemen. I\\'m taken and am no way in need but I guess you could say the men are attractive here too. The girls are pretty nice as well. Surprisingly, the guys are actually nicer and more outgoing. There is a lot of diversity on campus: different groups, cultures, religions, etc. I enjoy associating with the many different people on campus. They\\'re fun to learn from.There are plenty of computers at the library, you can always at least find one open. If not they have computers in other on campus locations. Either way there is WIFI in every building on campus, which makes it very convenient if you have a laptop/iPad/tablet. Not owning your laptop will be no problem what so ever.UT Arlington has access to plenty of off campus housing. The community is continuing to grow and more housing is being built as we speak. There are available apartments, rental homes, and even condos around the campus area. There is somewhere to live for everyone.Is there an astronautical branch for aerospace engineering? If so, what are the requirements for acceptance into the school and  how much would the overall cost be???the basketball teams are the high light on campus, but i wish we had football.Six Flags and hurricane horbor are really close to the school, also Cowboy Stadium.Better know what you are doing because if not you will become a victim quick.You can\\'t do anything fun, people complain and it is too strict. Do not come here if you are looking for a fun time in college.Though there are no public transportation in Arlington.  There are on campus buses that take you around the whole campus.  It  is a Large campus, so having a bus is very helpful.  The bus drivers are very helpful as well if you didn\\'t know where you were going.There are a few dining options.  They are good but pricey.UTA takes pride in being a tobacco free campus.  You cannot smoke and carrying other drugs are  out of the question.  It is a very safe campus.Living in Texas, the weather is mostly hot all the time or mild and the campus rarely shuts down for inclement weather issues. There has only been one or two times in the last few years where classes were canceled, and that was because of severe ice on the roads or snow.The campus has many buses and bus stops around campus that students can use to get around. Walking isn\\'t a problem for me though and there are lots of parking lots around campus that to me, makes the transportation obsolete unless you happen to have to park at a lot that is far away from where most of your classes are.UTA\\'s facilities are top notch. I started on the campus back in 2007 and there has been nothing but additions and improvement across campus. I love the activity center where I can go work out for free and I love all the new food place additions to the campus that have come recently. The new college park district is top notch, and attracted many great restaurants and places to hang out. Overall, I love the campus, and wish I did more things on campus and went to more activites and used more the facilities on campus then I actually do.I think the night life is alright but the university lacks a central district to hang out and bar hop. It would be nice to make an area that has the feel of 6th Street, North Gate or Fry Street, examples of drinking rows near other universities in the state.People of all races, languages, backgrounds, and creeds attend the University of Texas at Arlington.Make all A\\'s in pre-requisite courses. Discuss degree plan with a counsellor in person, don\\'t try to figure it out on your own.I would reccommend an intership to any nursing graduate. I was able to train directly into the ER with no experience. The pay is low and I had to sign a 2 year contract, but  I am doing what I wanted to do and have more experience in 1 year as many floor nurses get in 5+ years.It\\'s so boring here. There isn\\'t much public transportation or activities on campus. Everyone keeps to themselves. The shopping centers are far away. There aren\\'t many events, and I\\'m scared of wandering off campus at night since someone gets robbed or beat up every week.There is a lot of variety in ethnicity, which is good. But most of them really aren\\'t that interesting or attractive. I\\'m more into more artistic, geeky or intelligent types--there aren\\'t that many here. However, they tend to be hardworking and athletic.There are some good options, but I get tired of all the asian food on-campus. However, there are new restaurants near the new dorms that are nice, but are expensive.They are expensive, but there are some nice options that allow you to split the cost between people--however it is difficult to get them due to high demand.Coming to the point of local atmosphere its nevertheless better compared to other universities based on safety and other thingsWe dont have such good transportation facility as it is a small town.I am not so happy with my major. I do not get to choose classes and professors I like when it comes to my major classes. Fortunately, the teachers here are quite knowledgeable.I feel like home here. There are tons of organizations on campus for you to choose from. The student center is nice and offers a lot of activities each day. Social life in UTA is not bad at all. Go check it out!They make it very easy to navigate on the MyMavs student center website. Everything comes itemized and clear of awarded aid/loans. Be sure to take care of all your financial needs as early as possible!Arlington is a terrific town with lots to do; especially so since it consists of large attractions such as Rangers Stadium, the Cowboys Stadium, Hurricane Harbor and Six Flags. It is relatively safe, provides lots of nightlife and dining dining options, is easy to navigate, and has a mix of people of various ages.The campus has a diverse crowd in terms of cultural diversity and lifestyles. It doesn\\'t seem hard to meet new people since it is a bustling place and eager minds are all here for the same purpose. Given the new eat/drink/shop additions, it provides more places for entertainment amongst each other.There are several options for dining now, the newer dorm area has lots of selection from frozen yogurt, burgers, pho and sandwiches!It\\'s TEXAS, very unpredictable but there is a weather system around campus that warns students, faculty, and staff when there is bad weatherthe basketball games are great, but they need a football team.it can be really expensive and really nice or really s****y and cheap. either you are close to campus though.UTA is known for its diverse student body. Every race, black, white, african, hispanic, asian, indian and more is found on this campus on a day to day bases. there are clubs and organizations for each race as well as for the many religions on campus. there are also groups for LBGT and allies such as the GSA- gay straight alliance. Everyone has somewhere they can belong to. It is one of the biggest mixture of people I have seen and it works wonderfully. i dont think I would have been happy anywhere else or met as many unique people and made this many interesting friends, from whom i now have a chance to learn about different cultures and beliefsThe fine arts classes for my major in visual communication are great. Yes the professors have a the basic rules and guidelines that need to be met, but they let you discover and explore many options. Many of the professors if not all of them have worked in the field or still are and are able to give great advice on jobs, internships, and of course the actually work your produce. They are always there to answer questions and offer opinions as to where to to take your project. There are a small amount of VC professors, but you get to create relationships with them which I think is wonderful. I really enjoy my major and my professors.UTA has a lot of diversity, it\\'s the only campus I\\'ve been on that is not mainly white.I have not had any personal run-ins with the police on campus. However, I do see plenty of them around, they are everywhere at the rec center, library, walking around. They don\\'t seem to have a god complex or anything, they are just there to keep us safe.There are not many shuttle buses that drive around campus. The ones that do dont travel very far around.The school is very serious about the honor code the first time a professor turn you in they will not allow the professor to drop your lowest grade. The next time you will be suspended,and lastly you ill be exspelled. I am not really sure about the policys in the dorms because i live off campus.Their are all types of guys and girls at UTA ranging from different ethnicity to majors, allowing it to be easy to meet different people in every class and social activity.UTA is the most diverse campus you will ever see! You can meet people from all over the world. Students, faculty and staff greatly appreciates the diversity here.Well it\\'s Texas!  So expect bipolar weather! It\\'s freezing one day and next day you are wearing shorts.There are many computer labs on campus. You can probably find a spot somewhere. They work fine and the speed is good too. There are also many printers and the cost is not that much. Very cheap. If you are an engineering major you get free printing at Woolf Hall.Plenty of restaurants to choose from on campus. The sushi and sandwhiches prepared in the cafe are good too.Lots of things to do around town. Close to Dallas and Fort Worth and there\\'s always something going on for everyone.It is usually sunny and nice outside for a good 9 months. The summer\\'s can get pretty high in temperature but some utilize that to tan more and such. If snows classes usually will be cancelled since it doesn\\'t snow much around here.Arlington itself isn\\'t a very \"happening town\" but since it\\'s located between Dallas and Fort Worth, you don\\'t have to travel very far to find things to do. Sure the Cowboys stadium is located here but college kids usually don\\'t have the means to buy those expensive tickets anyway.We just recently got new nice computers installed in the library on campus. The University of Texas at Arlington\\'s WIFI are pretty fast with usually no troubles at all. Usually, students bring their own laptops which is more convenient for them, but those who don\\'t sometimes can find a hard time looking for a computer to use.Greek life plays a part more for fraternities and sororities. They throw a lot of parties but it does not play a big part on campus unless you\\'re a member of a fraternity or sorority.The University of Arlington of Texas are always prepared for any situation if a student feels unsafe. We have poles scattered around campus we can go to and press a button to alert the UTA polices where we are at according to which pole we alert them on so that they can be aware there is something going on. I see UTA police cars every day when i go to campus which helps me feel secure if anything happens to me. At night, if students are studying late, we are able to call security to escort us out and walk with us to our destination if we feel scared or unsafe. If there are any security reports, students always receive e-mails instantly about what situation happened and the details about it so that we will be aware of our surroundings and the e-mail also provides helpful tips.The Biology schedule that UTA provides for me is somewhat helpful. I am not sure what i want to be yet besides the fact of being in a medical field profession. So, currently, I am following this outline of my college career to choose the classes that i\\'m currently enrolled in. The workload is bearable. The more time you spend studying, the better your performance will be on exams. Classes are fairly interesting and helpful. I enjoy going to class at UTA.Varsity sports at University of Arlington Texas are not huge compared to other college campuses but plays a big part for our school. We don\\'t have a football team, but our basketball team is pretty good. We have great coaches to help our varsity teams become where they are today. Intra murals sports play a huge part on our campus since it is open to anyone who are interested in joining. Our teams are very diverse as well.there are not many scholarships available. And the ones that do have a lot of requirements.there are not many different food places available. there aren\\'t many people walking around.We have different heritage months . so each month a different culture is celebrated.Not many option when it come to picking professors . Not much help with financial aid if its not done on time,Everything is pretty laid-back. I only wish everyone wasn\\'t so up tight about tobacco use.There is really a lot of stuff to do in the actual city of Arlington, places to eat, things to see, but the city is a little too overcrowded for my liking. If you\\'re in to the hustle and bustle of a big city, this is the place for you.There are so many options for majors, the professor\\'s genuinely care about their teaching subjects, the advisers are so helpful, and depending on which classes you take together and how many hours the work load is as manageable as any other.I think this school has a unique and very advanced nursing program and scientific research at the moment.There\\'s 3 different types of dorms and they are your average prices among universities. It is highly convenient to live in dorms because they are right on campus and they also enable more social interactions between students.There\\'s a great number of computers available and they are in almost every building. Never had an issue with any of them.I\\'m a psych major, and my professors are top of the line.As a nursing major, I am completely satisfied with my decision! No matter what your major is, you meet new people of different types!The best place to eat on campus is at the University Center. They have Pizza Hut, Panda Express, Chick-Fil-A, Subway, and even Japanese and Chinese food!Drugs aren\\'t that big at UTA. It really depends on who you hang out with! Mostly people just smoke. That\\'s really it.My school helped me to stay focused and I received an A in one of the most dificult classes this semester.Not much different about our school then others. It is smaller than schools that my friends go to so the professors learn who you are. As for the building many of them are new buildings.Student life on campus is fantastic. Every day I walk to class I walk by student organizations and events put on by them in the middle of campus.UTA provides tons of opportunity to advance in your field of study. The computer science program is fantastic. We just built a new building for our department of engineering and it is state of the art. The workload can get crazy at some times but there is always a place to go on campus to seek help. there is free math tutorial rooms and a lot of the clubs will also help you out with work and questions you havePeople here are very friendly, which is why it is up there with the top diverse universities.The gym needs new equipment.Like the campus but just wish there was more people that helped us learn about events and things to do on campus.I like how affordable it is and how everyone just minds their own business. It\\'s pretty small for the student size thoughI love the school, professors are amazing. Glad I choose the school. 10/10 would encourage people to apply to Uni. of Texas.The gymnasium needs a  major face lift, due to the age of the building the pool area would need to add new structure and to warm the pool.Because I cannot participate more than I would like to in my university, there is no support for less than part-time. Full-time working parents.The career centers are very helpful with students to obtain a career.The teachers are willing to teach the students on topics in the course.The cops drive around the campus to protect students.They had very nice dorms for the students.Greek life help relieve the stress of classes.A lot of students show up to support the teams.There are a lot of clubs and events in the college.I don\\'t really have any thing to say on this because I don\\'t know.Classes are not just classes, it\\'s more of an open world to learn about other people in relation of the subject.I feel safe stepping out both at morning and night, and it\\'s an easy access to the school police departmentWonderful experience of your environmentI gives us the ability to socialize easilyUta plays a big part in sports due to their diversity, bringing many talents together.I just needed to complete a full semester at the university to be decalred since I was a transfer student. Be sure to stay on mymav, looking at your to do list because something new popped up everyday for me.I enjoy it greatly because it challenges me in which it will allow me to enhance my skills for when I join the workforce. Most of the instructors are very approachable and willing to help as long as you show effort. I am in the college of business and major in marketing.There\\'s always cops on duty, campus rides available.School spirit in general is decent but the problem is with only basketball and baseball as the major sports to root for, there is not much variety. Apart from the softball and ladies basketball, there is not much to really cheer for in the athletics sense. Fan support is also a disappointment since the seats would be sold out and the turnout is lackluster.For the ones that live on campus, they have the selection of a meal plan. For everyone else there are the few restaurants in the same area as the cafeteria for the students that have a meal plan. The variety available is okay but it can be improved if the times they are available would coordinate with the times regular franchises close. Overall the places, meal plans and dining halls are not too shabby.the restaurants around UTA are not very good quality.Food is great for the first couple weeks then it gets old. They do try to make it interesting and have made changes after student\\'s feedbacks so they are improving a lot but you do start to miss your mom\\'s cooking.There are emails that alert any crimes that are around campus, but i have never witnessed anything like that and I walk to the MAC Gym around 10 to 11 at night and feel totally safe by myselfPeople don\\'t seem to indulge in drugs in UTA, it is a tobacco free campus so even smoking ciggarettes are looked down upon and mostly everyone smokes where they are not visible or they have their own smoke area.UTA is very diverse. I\\'ve met people of all backgrounds, age, religion etc. Everyone I\\'ve met is very open and friendly.They\\'re decent enough. If you were in the top 10% of your high school you can easily get a scholarship that is renewable each year.There\\'s a ton of stuff around the school. A little ways off is Six Flags, Texas Rangers Stadium, and Dallas Cowboys Stadium. There\\'s lots of places to eat and tons of places to go.The commuter labs and all the computers in the library are usually very crowded at any time during the day/year. I can never find a computer becasue they\\'re always being used by other students. Throughout the entire semester, I probably got lucky and found a spot once or twice.UT Arlington life on campus is overall tranquil. Sometimes, I take the long route to class to enjoy the scenery. There are many nice libraries throughout the campus for each school. The architectural library is my favorite, with the view of the garden and water fountains outside the windows. There is also a nice recreational facility called the \"MAC\" (Mavericks Activities Center). There are two inside tracks, tread mills, a weight room, racket ball courses, swimming pools, wall climbing, and ping pong tables. There are also certain exercise courses and activities offered such as yoga, martial arts, and zumba classes.There are many middle eastern and eastern Asian students on campus. The guys on campus that I\\'ve met so far are generally friendly, although the ones in fraternities are subtly arrogant, but with more confidence than anything, a quality in which I admire. Most of them also seem to have strong beliefs in their religion and conviction in their academic plans. The girls also are generally friendly, but they are more likely to form cliques with other girls of their same culture; they don\\'t completely exclude an \"outsider\", but they would prefer to have social gatherings with their own. I have met both guys and girls who are very intelligent and tenacious with their college careers.UT Arlington is steadily growing in prestige as more students enroll each year. The participation at school events isn\\'t as active as other colleges with football teams, but the school spirit is still alive. The fact that UT Arlington is one of the most diverse campuses in the U.S. makes my college a perfect place for cultural learning. There are many opportunities to meet people from around the world who share their culture with others on campus in many cultural activities and events. I have enjoyed meeting people of all nationalities while growing in knowledge about the world around me.Living on campus is safe. The dorms are well maintained and the RA\\'s and managers are more than willing to help.UTA takes student\\'s safety seriously. At most a bike gets stolen, but no serious crimes has taken place.When it come down to off-campus restaurants, UTA has come a long way. By opening up College Park District, they have added about seven new eateries that every culture can enjoy, all within very short distances away.There are a lot of great proffessors and there is such a wide variety of classes you can take.It does not snow a lot here, so the classes do not get cancelled much. It does get extremely cold and sometimes a little rainy, so that effects the campus experience.I came to UTA as a back up plan, and after spending over a year, I\\'ve come to my senses about UTA. Living in Arlington my whole life UTA did not seem like a huge college compared to some of the more prestigious school, but I\\'ve come to learn its a huge school for engineering, nursing, business and science degrees.Arlington in itself is striving to promote a more \"college town\" atmosphere with the addition of new downtown restaurants and bars which really bring the majority of the business from UTA students.Not having football team at UTA puts a big burden on the campus involvement.Joining the Greek Life community on campus has dramatically changed over the years. 10-20 years ago Greek Life was a huge part of the UTA students, 30% of the entire student body was involved in the Greek community. Times have changed, and its not as huge as it once way. Parties are still there, and the social aspect view of Greek is not as recognized as much anymore.There are so many restaurants and bars around campus!! Honestly, entertainment and things to do in the DFW area is one of the best things about UTA. Hooligan\\'s just moved into a new location, and it\\'s a classy, elegant-looking, English-pub-style bar. Freebird\\'s just opened, as well as Smiling Moose Deli, which is right under Vandergriff (a dorm) in the college park center. Bentley\\'s is like a million years old, but it\\'s the cutest pub ever - the regulars will literally sit and play cards for hours, people even study there. Also we just got Digg\\'s tacos which is right on campus (it\\'s delicious).Sometimes the internet connection in my dorm sucks, but the computers in buildings and at the library are pretty nice. :)We don\\'t have a football team, and let\\'s be honest, that sucks a LOT. However, basketball is huge, and our Movin\\' Mavs team (wheelchair basketball) is fun to watch. Homecoming has become a huge event with a parade, this dance party thing (they close off an entire street), people paint their cars and faces, it\\'s really fun!The  weather should have no effect on you grade. It could calm you down and help you learn better with the soothing noise. Texas has pretty normal weather nothing out of the ordinary at least while the semster is going on it shouldnt have to much of an effect on your grade. Really what determines your grade is the determination to get the grade by studying and focusing on the material.You have to get there early to have any semblance of a good spot, like 7:30 am. If you are trying to park at noon forget about trying to get a good spot, getting a spot at all is the hardest part. Then the pricing on the parking sticker is insane! The parking tickets are a bit strict but not extremely costly.I gave UTA a B+ because I start in the Spring and have yet to attend classes. From visiting the campus I have only been able to base my grade off of looks. It does look beautiful and I\\'ve only ever heard good things about the education. I look forward to Spring 2013!I think the cost is reasonable, haven\\'t received a ticket or fine yet so can\\'t inform you much on that. You can park and leave your car in the same place due to the ease of walking from class to class unlike other schools i have attended. Parking is fairly available i say use the garage if you have the extra money to do so.Nice dress, nice hair and eyes. Usually study in the day time and party hard at night. Most are very faithful once they find a relationship. It\\'s a nice range of types of girls such as preppy to southern belles.There is only two major sports that are very advertised throught, those are basketball and vollleyball, there are a lot of fans that support. The athletes themselves try to get peole involoved and go to the games.I like that there is a section where most of the students classes are, so it isn\\'t hard to find people for study groups, ther are also various places where people can go and study for free. The library is very eay to get to, and so people can use it and go to. It doesnt get crowed to get to class as much. There are event always going on for students to go to.UTA is a very generous school. It gives out a large amount of financial aid money every semester. I almost have a full ride thanks to financial aid. My advice for getting the financial aid is: fill out FAFSA, apply for scholarships, do well in school, and take the SAT.Since the school is in the center of Arlington, there are restaurants literally everywhere. Some are expensive while others are not. There are restaurants for every type of food too. And it is all within five to ten miles of the school.The people at UTA are some of the nicest people you could get to know. While the school does have a white majority, it has dozens of ethnicities in its family of about 34,000 students. It is one of the top choices for transfer students as well. The social aspect of the school is great because there are always people around campus to talk to, get to know, and join events with.Gettig into the school was a breeze. The nursing program is hard to get in, very competative. Grades are very important. i did not get in the first time (i did the second time). You get extra consideration if you complete your sciences at UTA. The program is challenging, the testing is totally different from wht you are use to. But they have a success center that is very helpful. These are nurse educators who want to see you succeed.I like the campus. The buildings are easy to navigate and there is a lot of open space in front of the library to relax between classes.The drug scene at UTA is not visible to me. People are not openly expressing their participation in drugs if they use any.Six-Flags is right at the corner as well as the mall. The MAC is the recreation place for most students and its a great place to hang out. Safety is great and there are people monitoring safety. And there are many events to attend like the lighting at UTA.Eating at the dining hall is a great option becausernIt is all you can eat type of buffet with different types of foods. There is even a line for vegetarians, and it is much cheaper to eat at a dining hall when one is hungry.There are many great convient food places around school, especially since my school is right off the main street of Arlington.Facilities are good overall. No complaints about anything. There are many great spots to study and students respect those areas by not being too loud and obnoxious. There are so many great student acticity programs to join and they have great events.So far, everything is great and convient. There are many food places that just opened up on campus (wihch is very good). The campus is not too big, everything is within 15 minutes of walking distance and it\\'s not a hastle to get there. Once you adjust to where each building is, it\\'s pretty much automatic.student parking lots need permitrngarage parking/hrMavericks activity center at UT ArlingtonrnCowboys stadiumrnZoos and museumsrnVaried parks mall for shoppingThey just put in the College Park center which has a bunch of cool places to eat to add to the dining halls and other restaurants on campusArlington is a really fun city but if you\\'re not 21 your options are just house/frat partes, which are fun & basically free. Fort Worth & Dallas are just around the corner and a lot of fun too.Its not all that great...We need more nightlife places closer to campusSchool spirit... Campus life in dorms and apartmentsThe professors I had this semester were great! They were very helpful and as a freshman, they made me feel welcome. The registration process is easy once you figure out how to go through it, but the classes go quick so look ahead in the catalogue to set up what you want to register for so at 12:01, you can just click a button and be enrolled. The workload for me wasn\\'t so bad this year but I only took four classes. I recommend studying farther in advance for tests, especially for chemistry. Popular study areas on campus are definitely the third and fifth floors of the library, they\\'re specifically for studying. Another place plenty of students go in the lobby in the University Center with all of the comfortable couches.This semester at UTA has been great; my classes weren\\'t a heavy load at all for me. The nursing program is very specific, there is very little wiggle room if you are wanting to graduate in four years but it is very thorough. My instructors for this semester were amazing! My chemistry teacher explained everything so it was easy to understand; if you didn\\'t understand the first time around, he was more than willing to explain it a second or third time if need be. Overall, these professors know what they\\'re talking about and make your life as a student easy.You\\'ve got your basic fast food chains (ie McDonald\\'s) right off campus, but if you go a few blocks over into downtown Arlington you find a few jewels such as J Gilligan\\'s Bar & Grill and Fuzzy Taco\\'s.Most of the buildings were built in the 70\\'s I believe so they look like it but aren\\'t shabby or anything. The new ERB building is very modern and pretty sweet.Other then a few areas under construction, the overall feel of the campus is very cozy, almost rustic.Campus seems pretty safe. There is a clinic located in the campus. University also has a Police team located on campus!I received both scholarship and financial aid at UT Arlington and it was a pretty easy process!Although they are adding new parking garage to campus, currently parking is still a little uneasy!Between two major cities Dallas-Fort Worth. There are a lot of places within a 20 minutes drive! While you can enjoy cultural district in Fort Worth, you could also find finest restaurants and other fun places in Dallas!A lot of festivities at the University. But they could have more variety in their festivities. It\\'s all oriented to sports and parties. Call me old fashion but having a nice outing for The Arts. Where people can share interests about it. Things of that nature. Or just something simple. Rather than having a loud party.The professors and academic advisors all seem knowledgable and have helped me figure out what I needed.There are all types of students that attend, all nationalities. Every style imaginable.Shuttle bus will pick and drop you off anywhere you need to be on campus.  Very convenientThe Facilities are very clean and student friendly. Students are nice and there are alot of activities that a student can get into.Very busy, the major problem is the parking situation at campus,  they have more students then available parking places.  Charge $130 for a pass that only lasts a year or less depending when you get it and you cant find an available parking spot close to where you have class.Living in a metroplex, there are pleanty of eating opportunities available at a low cost and high value.You will need to apply early for financial aid, but after the initial walk-around, it is an easy process.Greek life makes school life more enjoyable and interesting.  They have fun events and make the atmosphere light.I am very happy with my major in nursing. In just over a year I will graduate and hope to be working in a hospital in the emergency room and to one day work as a helicopter flight nurse.The computers on campus at the library can be troublesome at times but over all they have a pretty easy system for useage and for printing out documents and other materials for class. The on-campus internet is free to students and accessible in most places. Aside from issues of speed the system is pretty good.I\\'m not familiar with all the other choices at this school considering I transferred into my major and haven\\'t had to attend other buildings and curriculum but I would say that the school is above average in all the categories as far as major choices go. The workload in the nursing major is very heavy.I live off campus in one of the better apartment complexes with basic cable, internet, and washer/dryer included. I would say the experience here is really good but I don\\'t think it would be the same if I had choosen to live at a different complex.Nursing is a very hard major. Even having another degree I didn\\'t have to work as hard as I do now for this degree. The workload and time needed to complete all the requirements for school is enormous. The UTA facilities are very nice and mostly up-to-date. The SMART Hospital is a very handy and cool innovation for the students to take advantage of. Overall I would say it is a great program to be in and I am glad to be at UTA.Not a lot of night life or sports and the area can be seedy at night but the campus and the education it provides are above average with a great staff.At UTA, there are a variety of different ethnicity throughout the campus. Everyone seems to get along which creates a welcoming vibe in this university.It isn\\'t really a big deal if you join a frat or a sorority. No one makes a big deal out of whether or not you are in one. However if you want to join one, the process is relatively easy here at UTA.It was easy, all I had to do was apply for the school. Then I declared my major as mechanical engineering and enrolled in the classes.The engineering department seems very organized with many experienced instructors teaching the courses.The new Mav center is awesome.  Campus buildings are well maintained.  Lots of activities going on.Complete all the forms and submitted the required information earlyThe Dining hall has a lot of choices and the food is good.Dallas Cowboys stadium and Texas Rangers Ballpark are both in Arlington. The arena where the Dallas Mavericks play is in Dallas. There are clubs, lounges and bars all over DFW. There are also tons of cultural activities and restaurants. There isn\\'t a specific attitude towards students because a lot of locals are students too.There are apartments all over Arlington. Some are 20 minutes away from campus, others are 5 minutes away. Pricing can very depending on many factors such as gated communities, proximity to attractions, area of city and even floor level.A very diverse campus with many races and types of students. I\\'ve met fellow introverts and people who pull me aside and talk to me while I\\'m walking around. Students in class range from jokesters to intellectuals. People in the University Center play cards and games on their computers up stairs, others skate and bike around on campus. There are middle-aged students who have decided to go back to school, as well as recent grads. Most students are social and friendly, and PDA is never too much with couples. No one is indecent or obnoxious in their clothing or looks, and there is a warm air about campus most of the time.UTA has a very bustling campus. There are constantly musical, athletic, club, and other group activities to keep most students busy. Everyone is generally polite (holds doors open for you or will make small talk) and otherwise keeps to themselves. There are many options for food and many convenient stores around since UTA is essentially in the heart of Arlington.The student body here is very diverse, with students attending from all over the world. There is someone for everyone.I am in the Social Work program and I love it. The department is so friendly and helpful, and they encourage you to succeed!I know many students that have lived on-campus, and they have only wonderful things to say about UTA! they love the social activities, accessible dorms, and beautiful environment that UTA offers.The Athletics here at UTA is great! The school is very proud of their athletes and the students are very passionate about their school spirit.It feels great to see activities and events throughout the semester that are related to so many different majors on campus.  Work load can pile up if you allow it.  Time management is key.  Most buildings are a stone\\'s throw away.The atmosphere around UTA is positive and eventful throughout the year.  Thanks to the pro baseball and football teams close by and the summer concert series that takes place just north of campus, theres something going on often.The rules and policies in place help maintain a safe and secure environment for all on campus on any day, day or night.The only team that gets attention is the mens basketball team. We dont have football, and our women athletics sucks.we have a wide variety of majors to choose from and pretty much is taught be professors who specialize in each section. Its pretty neat.We have something that will appeal to everybody. dorms and apartments both are nice and comfortable to live in.The first two years you\\'re on campus everything is new to you, so you feel as if greek life is the greatest. But when you realize they throw the same party at the same time every year it gets old. Its not a big deal if you\\'re in a frat or sorority but they do amke it seem fun.The financial aid office is helpful, but they don\\'t give you the best and detailed information on how to get the most money for school. Its better to make an appointment wit senior advisors for the best help.I think UTA is one of the most diverse campuses out there. We have people from literally everywhere around the world. All of these different cultures coming together. There are tons of groups and clubs that you can join. You will definitely find somewhere to fit into.There is so much to do in the DFW area. We have the Cowboys and Rangers stadiums. Theres also Six Flags & Hurricane Harbor. Dallas is about 30 minutes away and is full of big malls, awesome restaurants, and fun night clubs. Fort Worth is on the other side and has the stockyards and a lot of other interesting things to look at. Never a dull moment.I have a car so I have no trouble getting around. I am aware that UTA has buses that go around all the time. They have set routes that will take you to different places. Definitely helpful if you stay on campus and don\\'t have your own car.I very much enjoy sporting events at UTA. They are very fun and everyone has a ton of school spirit. Its a lot of fun to dress in all school colors and cheer on the Mavs. The only thing I wish we had is a football team. That would definitely make UTA that much more exciting.Arlington is so Urban and helps you connect to the surroundings. So many restaurants, shops, rescources,night life, living, recreations. We have Six Flags and the Cowboy stadium! Always something fantastic to do in Arlington. You will never be bored!I am happy to be in the nursing major, it can tend to be rather challenging. If I could do it all again, especially my freshman year I would have looked more in depth at the professors i chose. Some of them really make the course difficult when it really doesn\\'t have to be. Nursing is always in high demand, so finding a job wont be too challenging, but I am ready for what my life will bring.The acceptance was relatively easy, the most difficult thing was finding a seat for a biology class. those classes fill quickly.My dream was to have a PhD and become something but being realistic i decided to fetch a career that wouldnt be too much of a gamble. instead of studying for 9 years i decided to shoot for a b.s. in nursing. Im not terribly scared of finding a job because nurses are always on demand. Yes, i would do it all over again.UTA strives to accept students of all races an nationalities and for this it is a very diverse campus.Campus strictness is pretty straight-forward at this University. The rules are set out in the code of conduct and most all of it is common sense.Greek life is expensive with monthly dues and mandatory events to attend. If you are looking for instant friendship and countless social events in college and money is not an issue than greek life is something to consider.Weather here is pretty average, however there have been some record-breaking winters for Texas where it has snowed and iced over.  Most classes are cancelled when weather is adverse so I have no complaints there. Summers are hot and the heat goes well into the fall semester, but again it is Texas so the heat should be expected.Living on campus at the University of Texas-Arlington has improved over the last few years with new expansions to the campus. There are many options ranging from dorms to apartments and lofts. Parking can be difficult around the university but living on campus provides a parking lot exclusive to that living space. I would recommend the newer apartments and dorms on campus as they are more spacious and convenient in location. Living on campus makes nice amenities such as the gym and eating facilities within an easy walking distance.Well, considering I am the oldest in my family, so going to college for the first time is hard for me. The reason is because I dont know what to expect, and so far UTA has helped me understand that it is okay to have a lower grade than high school. College is actually using all the lectures and exercise and put it into the real world. For me this grade is okay, but I am working really hard to maintain a A or higher because I know that getting into the Nursing program is highly competative. Know I know what I need to do for the Spring Semester. There is alot of tutoring oppurtunities, but I dont live on campus, so is hard for me to go to those seesions. Overall UTA has a lot to offer to the students.The financial aid is paid directly to the school. After the payment is processed, the student will be contacted for disbursement method of financial aid less costs of fees due to school.Growing Big. Located near the Texas Rangers and Dallas Cowboy stadiums, with lots of new  restaurants in the downtown area, and lots of little unique places too.Pretty fairly popular greek lives going on. They seem to be ok with each other. However as with most greek groups they have their own thing and own agendas and their own parties and things going on.It was a smooth process for the most part. There were some additional forms that needed to be filled out and extra papers submitted but other than that it had been a blessingI have not had any negative problems with the police. They are always very helpful and careful to make all aware of any dangers. The are strict in ways that any police officer should be and its for our safety and success.Computers are everywhere and are usually free, except for at mid-day hours and lunch. The printing stations are filled during that time because that is when everybody is on campus and everyone wants to get their work doneThey are really hard on attendance, at least on the past 2011 Fall semester, they started to be really strict.Classes don\\'t get cancel unless there is major weather alert.. And we are always notified.UTA is extremely diverse. There are many different races that attend the school and there is a good mixture of people that hang together and mingle. The school is accepting of all cultures and there are organizations to fit just about any.The weather is always really nice, my semester is almost up and I have not had to walk in the rain once. And everything is fairly close that even if the weather was bad it would not really matter.Financial aid plays a major role in my tuition, but for it to all work out smoothly, I have to contact the office constantly. One needs to make sure the office gets all the paper work and on time, early is always better. Also, contact them again a month before semester begins to make sure they are not missing anything from you.There are many attractions in the UT Arlington area; Six flags, hurricane harbor, the rangers stadium, and the cowboys stadium are really close by along with other attractions. The mall is at most 10 minutes away but there are many stores close by. There are many areas around campus that offer discounts for students as well.The workload given at UTA is fair and it really helps students understand the subjects for the most part. Also, most if not all professors either show that they really care for their students or at least care about what they teach.The women and men at UT Arlington are very chilled back no one tries to look like there better or more expensive than anyone. It is a friendly and chilled environment everyone is friends with everyone.At UT Arlington all they have is one shuttle that comes very often. Everything at this school is in complete walking distance. From the dorms apartments all the eating spots you can imagine. For me and my friends it is very convenient.DFW has a large immigrant population, and UTA seems to be one of the most accommodating schools.  It has good programs that are affordable to most income brackets.  Ive never seen anyone ridiculed or discriminated againstthere are hotties and ugos everywhere.  UTA is a good cross section of the DFW area as a whole.  There are many different social and academic groups around, and there is always someone in the quad selling burgers to fund raise.  It is easy to find something that you can put your heart intoThere are plenty of computers available around campus. The only time I recommend a personal computer is during finals week. It\\'s can be a bit hectic at times. Printing is very cheap and actually free in some of the student housing. I would not waste money on a printer but a laptop or personal computer would be a nice investment.The weather is great! It may be hot during the summer but the fall and winter months are amazing. Perfect weather in the fall and not too cold in the winter. It\\'s just right.My financial aid was taken care of and my left over dues were cut in half to make payments easier. I simply suggest that you begin early when it comes to scholarships and financial aid.There are so many places to go and so many things to do in arlington and around arlington that it is impossible to not have a good time.The campus is very convientiely placed in the town so nothing is too far away. The bus/ shuttle service comes even on weekends so it is very accomodating.The places around campus are good. Dining places on campus are good, and there\\'s a cafeteria (that most people tend to not eat at from what I know).  There\\'s a lot of choices around and on campus, some of the on-campus usually close at 3 though.I received a decent amount of financial aid, but it wasn\\'t as easy as I thought it would be. A couple of my forms got lost in the shuffle, so I had to stay on top of things. I suggest making regular in-person appointments with your financial aid officer to make sure things are going smoothlyI do not own a vehicle, but the parking is not very bad here. My friend has always been able to park around his dorm whenever I\\'ve driven with him. And other friends have not complained about the parking either.There is a small amount of drug usage at Arlington, but for the most part I don\\'t hear much about it. It\\'s regulated and enforced very well, and I have never felt pressured to do drugs or drink. Smoking is almost non-existent.This grade is somewhat influenced by my gender, but there have been pretty adequate measures to ensure that students are safe. There are police services ready to respond on campus, and the surrounding areas have posed little-to-no danger to anyone that I\\'ve spoken to.There are a lot of different places close by, and even more if you\\'re willing to make just a short drive.  UTA is in between the Arlington Highlands and Lincoln Square shopping centers, which both have a lot of great casual dining choices, and there are plenty of other locations as well, both chain and mom-and-pop sort of places.rnrnMost places right by campus offer a student discount, which is not always very big, but still can be helpful.There are a lot of student apartments and lower rent houses just off campus, and plenty of non-student apartments a little further away, as well.You\\'ll want to be sure you get to campus a reasonable amount of time before your class to be absolutely sure you get a spot with enough time to make it, but there really are a decent number of parking lots available, and shuttle service if you end up parking in a lot that\\'s not the best walking distance from your class.  There is the new parking garage as well, although a garage permit does cost extra.rnrnMy only real gripe about parking is the cost of the permits.Being Greek at the school is not as important as it might be at other universities, but it is there.  Most people at this school are just trying to further their careers with a degree or even just finish a degree.The parking lots near the engineering and business buildings fill up very quickly, however, if you drive over near the Fine Arts building, you can find parking.  At worst, you may have to wait 15 minutes for someone to leave.  Also, a parking permit is very affordable.  There is also a parking garage off of UTA Boulevard, but it is pretty far from the center of campus.If you don\\'t take classes during the summer, the weather here in the DFW area is not too bad.  In August and half of September, it\\'s pretty hot, but once you make into October, the weather stays pretty temperate until mid-December.  We do get some pretty serious ice storms (and we don\\'t know how to handle ice storms in Texas), but other than that, winters here are very tolerable.A lot of the young girls and guys are fairly attractive and pretty smart.  We have a diverse crowd, especially when you head towards the side of campus with the engineering and sciences buildings.  We also do have a lot of guys and girls who already have families and are commuting to finish their education.There are a good number of students from all over the world especially Asia. Acceptance is not widely practiced because most some students prefer not to be around people who belong to different cultures from theirs.The convenience with off-campus housing is that you regulate your own time to come in and go out. Nobody checks on you.Police and safety services are excellent especially as every student is required to have a police contact for emergency purposes. Besides one would find police patrolling the campus from time to time looking out for the students. I have never felt unsafe on this campus.Student involvement in athletic facilities at the University of Texas-Arlington is admirable. With the improvement of the Mavericks activities Center you can find a \\'stream\\' of students visiting the center for these activities. I have personally been there and it is worth visiting.I had a wonderful time with the biking.you always see faces from all other nations, especially from AsiaThere are many guys and girls. UTA is a diverse school so you will see many International students from India to China. The girls and guys are also with different styles so artsy and some more athletic.In UTA I am satisfied with the courses there. There are many Nursing majors but it is nice because we get to help each other and compare professors.I came to UTA because it has a school of nursing. Courses are interesting and not too difficult you just have to try hard and study.Not much in the town of Arlington.  Not much of a downtown either.  The only thing you will find here is chain restaraunts.I was able to get a pell grant and everything was one time.There is a variety of major and minor resturant chainMainly residental living. Lots of resturants and stores. Traffics bad near the malls and freeways.Feels good most of the time.  Gets real hot in the summer on some daysThere\\'s great diversity on campus, i have met people from all over the world.The parking on campus is dreadful, it can sometimes be impossible to get a spot even after driving around for 30 minsI love UTA because of its diversity. I am an international student here and i feel like i am meant to be here, all the students here are very welcoming and also there is a high probability of finding someone from your country here.there are now more options with parking on campus, but its still advisable to get to school 30 minutes early in other to get a spot.there is a no drug or alcohol use policy in the residence halls, and i can say its a very strong policy and the RAs on duty are kin to follow these rules and can call the policy on anyone found violating this rule.UTA\\'s sports facility, the Maverick Activity Center, is awesome! Two indoor track fields, an indoor and outdoor soccer field as well as an indoor and outdoor basketball field. Also, the library holds one of the largest book vaults in Texas, which helps for researching materials. The new dorm, Campus Edge as well as the College Park Center are so aesthetically pleasing and if you get into Campus Edge, you have access to a pool for those hot summer days. There are so many activities for everyone to do as well as fun concerts.Texas has a strange climate, so typically, during the spring and early summer, due to rain, tornadoes and hot weather, it becomes uncomfortable, however for weather like tornadoes, there are safety spots and when the occur, it\\'s broadcasted around the school. As for the fall and winter, it isn\\'t as bad and some classes, depending on the teacher, are cancelled.It\\'s a rather calm atmosphere in UTA. Be nice and you get treated back the same way. However, people are rather outspoken about their views, which is a plus.The campus is very shaded so that even when it is very hot you still have the ability to feel cool. When it is cold, it is cold but very nice.The town is AMAZING. We have the Texas Rangers Stadium, Dallas Cowboys Stadium, Six Flags Over Texas, the Parks Mall, Cowboys Dance hall, and many other fun and exciting attractions. Many people believe that arlington is not safe, but in reality I fell just as safe as I would in my hometown.Trying to do nursing just as everyone else lol. Pretty good but hard professors which is necessary in this career.I can see people from around the world gather here.The parking is not synchronized with the student population!UTA provides so man resources, but it\\'s up to you to use them. They\\'re improving all the time. It\\'s one of the most diverse places I\\'ve ever seen. You will meet so many cool and different people. The planetarium is cool, and the new college park center is awesome. They\\'re trying to make UTA less of a commuter school by putting in more shops around campus.Arlington is a great place to live. There is so much to do here. Six flags, hurricane harbor, the ranger stadium, the cowboy\\'s stadium, so much good food, close to I-30 and I-20, right between Dallas and Fort Worth, UNT is an hour away, DBU is 20 minutes away; all great things!It\\'s pretty important to have a car in this area. The school tries to make it easy for students who don\\'t have a car by providing a little grocery store, and you can buy certain necessities at the book store, but if you want to go anywhere off campus, you will take a long time walking. Parking on campus is crazy in the mornings. You have to arrive on campus early to find a close spot (if you\\'re a commuter student). If you live on campus you\\'re not going to have a hard time parking.Mostly Windows, few iMacs in the library and other places. Can print wirelessly however (which is a plus) So I don\\'t usually need to use the computers provided. Thank god for a MacBook Pro.We have limited international students (that are not asian). The girls that dress nice are rare because everyone usually either wears  their greek life neon or orange color shirts (which get old) or just comfortable clothes. I like seeing people dress up so I don\\'t feel weird if I\\'m the ONLY one trying to dress the part. It is almost socially frowned upon to dress nice, at times. Furthermore, there is plenty of talent, you just have to have game.I would say the process for getting into the academic partnership was a blessing!  There is a abnormal app process but it is helpful and effective for the working student.  The school is exceptionally helpful in this matter!So far this school has been really helpful in the admission process.  The academic advisors have been patient and always available for help.UTA has largely been considered a commuter college, so most students are local and did not move from very far to attend the college.  From my personal expierience, it has the typical feel of a metropolitan community and a \"melting-pot\" mix of races and ethnicity.  Religion, however, seems to be more significant than I\\'ve experienced elsewhere, with on-campus organizations with dedicated buildings for Christian groups.Arlington is very up-and-coming of recent.  Within minutes of campus is Six Flags over Texas - the first of the Six Flags chain of amusement parks, the Ballpark at Arlington - host of major league baseball and home of the Texas Rangers, and the brand new Cowboys Stadium.  The area surrounding the campus is undergoing many upgrades including new restaurants, apartments and condos, and bars and evening entertainment.  UTA is working very closely with the city to invigorate the community surrounding campus and turn Arlington into a worldwide destination.My degree is in Biology, preferably wildlife biology.  Unfortunately, the school does not offer a wildlife biology program.  Most of the students attending are pre-med and pre-dental, but most of the professors are ecologists and herpetologists.  The workload depends on the class, but if you want a good GPA, expect lots of study time.  A benefit to take advantage of is the Chemistry Clinic and the SECC (the science education center).The school is on its way to obtaining a Tier one status, and is working to improve its departments such as chemistry to get there.  I\\'ve had great professors such as Dr. Rogers in chemistry and Dr. Frederick in biology.Campus provides transportation around campus and to your parked vehicle during night-time hours so that students do not need to walk alone and in the dark.  Notices are also emailed by campus police on a regular basis, updating students on security risks, recent incidents, and precautions to be taken.everyone is friendly and outgoing. finding someone of interest isnt very difficult.the weather constantly changes from super hot to super coldthe scholarships get in fast and its easy to keep track ofAccounting is a very difficult major at UTA, and the professors will tell you that up front.  Some people take math classes at other community colleges in order to avoid UTA math classes.  If you can make it though I\\'m sure the difficult classes will pay off.  UTA also offers a lot of opportunities to Accounting majors such as internships.There are plenty of differing cultures at UTA, as well as events that occur throughout the year that celebrates cultures.  As a whole rnUTA is very accepting of different cultures, sexual orientations, economic background and religion.There are plenty of labs but they tend to be very crowded depending on the time of day.  I tend not to try to deal with printing things at UTA if possible sometimes the printers mess up.  The Wifi works well in pretty much the entire campus, and it\\'s fast.The campus is pretty safe. Police and security are always roaming the campus, and I have never felt threatened.Everyone here is pretty average looking, and dress like low income students.It took a very long time to receive my aid, and the people at the office were very rude.The scholarships are good but you have to make sure to get in there early to be eligable. Even if your a few days late, it could cost you a good amount of money.Everyone seems nice and dedicated to learning. There is a wide variety of people who go there which is nice so you know they aren\\'t favoring anyone.  Nobody plays practical jokes on people like i have heard of at other universities. And there is simply a nice environment, beautiful campuses, wonderful teachers, and a good library.No the process was fairly easy. There is an entrance exam for my Accounting courses once I get into my later junior classes.Its looked in a very busy area to me but it have many things located around the school for students. There is many shopping centers and dining in the area. It is about 15 minutes from to major cities with plenty of things to do like Pro sports, nightlife, concerts and beautiful downtowns.There are many programs to choose from. I am undeclared but it will be business intended. My advisors are very helpful at giving me resources to help be understand better what i want to do. I am leaning towards accounting or information systems. I havent looked to much in the job search, but i will be looking into internships that my advisors have stated they would help with, when i declare a major.the freshman dorms are good. KC hall and Lipscomb are very okay and livable with a lot of fun activities. avoid brazzos though.It\\'s very diverse and fun place to set your future goalsThey are always hiring somewhere on campus, I always get emails about jobs.The classes aren\\'t extremely packed, so you can easily communicate with professors and peers.I love how safe the uta community makes me feel!I like the Arlington hall dorm, that\\'s where I\\'ll be staying. It is clean and has a lot of space.I plan on joining, so I\\'ll see what it\\'s actually about.It\\'s about the same as a regular college.I\\'m transferring to this school, I am currently enrolled but have not yet attended.I love it, perfect class sizes and profs are engaging and funI feel good. Except night classes idk the campus is dead with no one so it feels eerieI love it, great school, really cheap but classes are engaging and fun and I learn a lotA very diverse university at an affordable price!It\\'s unlike other places, these students care about more than just themselvesThere\\'s a new state of the art athletic center that proves that they careQuickly created a positive opinionIt is a school with teachers and advisors who care.Like I said before, I love it here! Yes, a few things need to be worked on, but it still is an amazing campus!I think we have a pretty good safety system, but honestly I think it could be upgraded a little more. I am a little afraid because I am in theatre and we usually have late night rehearsals, so we have to walk home in the dark.Thankfully, I got into the hall I wanted! I think they really take your preferences into consideration. I was actually sort of surprised that I was able to be in my #1 hall because I signed up later than everyone else. The housing process is really simple though.There are many sororities and frats and the people in them are very nice! I\\'m not in any of those, but I think Greek housing options are good. They have a big house for each group!It\\'s ok but this school focuses on the engeneering department the most.I came to this school because it provides a double major in criminal justice and in criminology and most schools don\\'t.People dress casual with regard of their appearancesometimes it\\'s very hot and students don\\'t like to participateThe places on campus are typical. UTA has Panda Express, Noodle House, Pizza Hut, Chik-fil-a, Subway, and Starbucks. UTA also has the Connection Cafe, which is the campus buffet-style dining hall. The food here is good sometimes, but not always. UTA also offers the POD which is like the on campus convenience store. So when you get tired of dining hall food, you can pick up snacks and microwave dinners here.Arlington is a growing city which offers Six Flags over Texas, the Rangers Ballpark, Hurricane Harbor, and now Dallas Cowboys stadium. Arlington also has the Parks Mall and Arlington Highlands shopping center. Fort Worth is about 20 minutes away and Dallas is about 30 minutes. Arlington has a very good location in the fact that it\\'s only a short drive to other major cities.Texan weather is unpredictable but most students here are Texan-bred, so they are well prepared. Somewhat extreme heat occurs in the warmer months, but otherwise, it doesn\\'t rain much and not a lot of outside factors  greatly affect getting to class.UTA is proud of its diversity and because of this, its student body is tolerant as a whole and many its arguable that white people are a minority here. Acceptance of race, sexual orientation, age, ethnic background, and international status is very prominent on campus.It\\'s within 20 minutes of Six Flags, Ranger Stadium, Cowboy Stadium, and maybe a little over half an hour from Dallas nightlife.Most are new and there are few technological difficulties associated with them. Because most people carry their own, there\\'s always a computer available for public use somewhere.Everything I have eaten here at UTarlington has been delicious!. I enjoy the atmosphere whenever I go to the dining hall. The food her overall is satisfying to me.i don\\'t really care much about the greek life on my campuspretty good, but not alot of places to eat at and things to doIts really hard in this program and you will need to remember everythingThe computer labs are usually full, and the scanerIt\\'s relatively easy to apply and receive financial aid but it would be nice for UTA to expand its scholarships.Parking is a particular issue at UTA.  The parking spaces nearest to campus buildings are always full, especially in the morning.UTA has a shuttle bus system that runs on a consistent basis but it could add a few more stops on the route.I havent had an internship yet, but I plan to find one. I feel that it is very important to get experience and to be able to have that going into the field. I am worried about finding one; however, i know that if I join the right student orgs it should be fairly easy to find one. Campus offers a lot of resources.The restaurants and cafeteria are easily accessible, but to receive some type of variety you must go off campus to surrounding areas.As an intern working with the UTA Sports and Recreation, I worked with providing programs and activities for disabled children looking to play and compete in sports.I received a valid amount of financial aid I deserved based on my income and enrolled courses. I would suggest that you assure to complete your fafsa in a reasonable amount of time before classes begin.University of Texas-Arlington is a great and thriving school!!! I have enjoyed my experiences with the faculty, TA\\'s, and  other students has been available for my every need.  I have attempted to be studious at University of Texas-Arlington, though my options remain open to other opportunities and schools.Arlington is a pretty large city with a lot going on. The Texas Rangers baseball field and the Dallas Cowboys stadium are very close to campus and offer the fun sports vibe that campus sometimes lacks (we don\\'t have a football team). The Parks Mall is only about ten minutes away as well as Six Flags and Hurricane Harbor. If you\\'re into the nightlife scene, downtown Dallas and Fort Worth are only a short distance away. If you want to stay in town, there are a lot of bars and restaurants that cater to college students and have good specials. The new College Park Center located on campus is host to many events all year. Last semester we had Drake come and we had the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders do a routine during our basketball game. If you can\\'t find something fun to do on or close to campus, then you\\'re probably not looking.Public relations and advertising fall under the communications department. We have fairly good professors, however there are also some I\\'d advise that you steer clear of. Check ratemyprofessor.com when you\\'re signing up for classes and make sure you\\'re making a good choice. There are a few tenured teachers that give students a hard time and are the only ones that teach certain required courses. The major is very interesting and there are a lot of passionate teachers willing to help you out and give you opportunities to find internships and work one-on-one with you. If you plan on getting a masters degree, be aware that the only one offered in the college of communications is a general masters on communications that covers all subjects and is mainly useful for those who wish to teach the subjects. If you want to be more on the graphic side of advertising, I\\'d also suggest just looking into graphic design since we don\\'t get the opportunity to take many of these classes as an ad major.UTA offers a lot of different majors, and there are several that we\\'re known for. From what I\\'ve heard, our nursing program and our engineering as well as other science programs are really competitive and well-known. I  am an advertising and public relations double major, so I\\'m not too familiar with them. I\\'ve only had a small handful of professors I actually disliked, but in general they\\'re all pretty good. If you\\'re in the same field as me, just be aware that our advertising program only lightly touches on the graphic design portion of advertising. If that\\'s more of the aspect that you\\'re interested in, you\\'d probably be better of in the Fine Arts school as a graphic design major.We usually have nice weather, but the temperature is unpredictable. If you walk out onto campus without checking the weather report, you may end up freezing when the day before was warm. It doesn\\'t rain too often, but when it does its important to have rain boots and an umbrella. Classes are very rarely cancelled due to weather, so in general UTA should score pretty high. Campus also has a lot of really pretty outdoor areas, so if you enjoy studying or hanging out outside, this is a good place to do it. There\\'s often events going on outside around campus, so its a fun place to be around lunchtime.Fantastic professors in the education department. The education I received has prepared me for the professional world. Class schedule can be arranged to accommodate a full time work schedule.I was a commuter student the entire time I attended and never had the need to use any public transpiration on campus. The university has added ample parking to relieve some frustration that all colleges have an issue with.Because of the crime bulletins emailed frequently I do not feel completely safe on campus, however, I never experienced or witnessed any of the various crimes that have happened on campus while I attended.The campus is very diverse in race and sexual orientation. As a big school, you can be almost sure you\\'ll have someone to connect with or find interesting. All coming from different backgrounds, students handle things different ways, like and dislike certain things about people they meet, and have hobbies that some people have never even heard of. You definitely learn a lot from those around you, and gain an appreciation for a diverse campus.All the basics are within walking distance, like Starbucks, Chipotle, pizza places, etc. There is something for everyone close by, and at low prices. The mood in these places might not be ideally college student \"cool\" but they are familiar and taste just fine in a pinch.Having the privilege of attending the BSN program at UT-Arlington has providing me with the knowledge I need to be successful. I am very happy and satisfy with the program.A lot of Hot girls, and most of them single... I suggest to stay at the dorms first semester or year to meet a lot of new people!There have been crimes, and even a body was found by campus.  I\\'m not sure I would walk alone at night all the time.There are lots of student groups to choose from and lots of fun eventsThey have great shuttle buses but they only go around campus. Just started branching out to the mallThe Fashion on Campus â€“ The fashion on campus is not that great. I\\'m really into fashion and it seems like nobody really has any. Whether its just wearing something cute to class or really dtessing up, the people here tend to not really care about what they are wearing. I only see someone once in a while that is wearing a super cute fashionable outfir. Of course I understand we are all poor college students and don\\'t have money or time be buying a lot of clothes.Good computers. They took away our free print moneyThe scholarships are good, but this again depends on academics which depends on the student. Even people who have the potential to get a scholarship can\\'t, because of the poor academic teaching.The academics are really not that great at UTA. It all depends upon the students - the teachers might say about helping you, but will not carry it through thoroughly. The student has to chase down the professor to get work done. Furthermore, the TA\\'s that teach classes go way too fast and therefore loosing students who take time to understand. The university is just all over the place.The health and safety centre is student friendly and the nurses are helpful if you have any concern. They make sure that students are fit to attend college.The Greek Life seems average and normal with occasional events going on, but it does not seem as inviting for a student as it should - resulting in a loss of interest or not so good college atmosphere.Keeping It in the Culture â€“ The campus has so much diversity. You can easily learn about almost every culture in the world in one place.UTA has great programs most of which are recognized around the country.Pricy but Reasonable â€“ Tthe prices of the off campus housing is expensive in comparison to some dorms however the rooms are bigger and give much more freedom.Great Basketball and Wheelchair Basketball! UT Arlington is an engineering school and doesn\\'t have a big sports scene but we definitely pride ourselves on basketball. At least the Texas Rangers are right down the road!At Least They\\'re Trying â€“ UT Arlington has a bus route for the school. The actual city of Arlington has no public transit, but most people wouldn\\'t ride the bus anyways...hence why they don\\'t have one! Parking isn\\'t too terrible...just get there early. Remote parking and shuttles are offered cheap.Concentration Portfolio Review for Studio Art â€“ All studio art majors have to submit a portfolio at the end of the basic coursework (usually sophomores). It is relatively easy to pass.Studio Art â€“ UTA isn\\'t really an \"art school\" but I ended up really liking it after some concerns about the lack of an art scene. Everyone is career-minded, practical, and supportive. Faculty and staff aren\\'t harsh or overly criticizing like other art schools in Texas. What I like is how the program is willing to teach beginning artists who have had no prior experience in art education. You can try as many times as you like, will never get kicked out and you can go at your own pace if you need to.Old, Cheap, and Perfect for Students â€“ There are a lot of older apartment communities that are run by the housing department. Not too much as far as luxury, but it\\'s just what a college kid needs! I lived on campus for a semester and always felt safe there. Stellar English Dept. Even for a Future Pastor â€“ A good amount of classes and professors for my major were stellar. After graduating, I found myself with a budding interest in Biblical studies, and ancient history. Some of the classes I took for compliment these interests. My goal is to go to seminary to eventually work as a missionary or pastor. I certainly enjoyed studying as an English major and would regret if I did not take several courses that I took at UT Arlington, however, I wish I had studied for my field in my undergrad.Accessible, Affordable, and Scrumptious Live on South Cooper St. Luckily, many delicious and affordable places surround the campus. Indian, Vietnamese, Greek, Italian and Labanese cuisine are all walking distance and under $10, in addition to many great fast food chains. Students are offered a plethora of eating options near and on campus.Ethnicly Diverse but Lacks Originality â€“ International students were frequently in my classes where they freely expressed their opinions. I reviewed and edited papers with people of different racial backgrounds, sexual preferences, and branches of educational disciplines. Quiet frankly, however, In a class specifically for English majors, though racial diversity was rather extensive, the thoughts expressed in debates were often fairly uniform and largely reflected those 21st century American culture.While parking in the morning is fairly decent, parking in the afternoon is a nightmare.  Be sure to leave at least 30 minutes to an hour before your class actually starts.Very Active â€“ I am personally not a part of the Greek life on campus, but I know several people involved and can see how they are a very active part of the university.Not Bad â€“ I personally have not had to find housing off of campus, though I have had friends obtain apartments close by. The apartments are nice and safe, and always close by. The rent did not seem to be too expensive compared to other apartments and always felt safe. They were also well kept and comfortable to stay in.They Do a Good Job â€“ I personally do not feel unsafe while going to school. They have shuttles and emergency stations for those who are uncomfortable walking, and if there is an incident it is alerted to all of the students immediately to warn them. All in all, they do their best to keep this school crime free and advise us on the best way to handle situations.No Regrets â€“ I was very happy with my degree, and now my career. UTA was a great experience with great professors. I obtained several tools and bits of knowledge that i still use today and will be with me life long. I am going back to UTA but for a MBA this time. So far this department has been just as helpful and knowledgeable as the engineering department.Very Easy â€“ Research deadlines and requirements online and send everything in on time. That is it basically.Challenging but Worth the Effort â€“ I felt the engineering department at UTA was top notch. Very nice facilities, challenging but very intelligent staff, and connections that I will have life long. Work load was a little over bearing but then again i was also working full time as an intern.Civil Engineer Intern â€“ I interned full time through my Civil Engineering undergrad. I felt the information I obtained through this experience was invaluable. College gave me the tools and ability to learn but on the job experience is what allowed me to put it all together and really jump start my career. I would encourage everbody to get their foot in the door where ever they can, as soon as they can to get a general feel of the industry they are persuing.Lots of Asians and Middle Easterns â€“ I\\'m not sure about any other particular fields but the engineering and computer science buildings are full of middle eastern and asian nerds. People dress nicely for the most part, and by nice I mean decent and casual- not like they\\'re about to go out.It really isn\\'t. You go to classes and back home/apartment. Dorms are crappy and not very popular. If there\\'s any drug use I haven\\'t noticed it. But it may be present a little with the freshmen.Good So Far â€“ I\\'m a transfer student so I\\'m a bit behind. I mostly got all the university core requirements out the way but fell behind on my computer science courses. Classes here seem good just make sure to go on ratemyprof.com before choosing one and signing up early because there aren\\'t many options available.SE Major, Not Too Hard to Get in â€“ if you do the work that is. Computer science isn\\'t for everyone but if you\\'re a nerd and love programming there shouldn\\'t be any problems. I haven\\'t met all the prerequisites yet but everything seems pretty straightfowards in terms of letting you know what you need in order to get in the program. Get calculus and physics out of the way early.New Dorms Are Very Nice. I\\'ve lived only in the newest dorm. KC. I\\'ve visited Arlignton Hall as well. Arlington Hall is fairly nice large shared area down side is number of entrances. Only the center so if you lived at the end its a long walk.rnKC Hall (I\\'ll butcher the name if i try) is new and very nice. The common area is large enough and the study areas are a huge help. Makes you focus generally. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are appropriate size (a little bigger than most other colleges i think.Walking to Campus â€“ Walking to Campus is normally laid out well. There are a large number of private Apartmant Complexes with a variety of amenaties and prices.There are a LOT of majors at this University. A lot of them find jobs right out of college and their professional programs are really involved.There are a lot of very involved Greek sections. Lots of them put on benefits for things and people in need. Also there are special events which turn out to be really fun.There\\'s many different choices for places and types of computers. There are even many different work settings available to use them.The places I have tried are not the best but are certainlty not the worst. Depends on your taste buds but the student discounts make it worth itI have seen a handful of guys that are attractive and a few for girls as well. Everyone dressed comfortable and they are very open about their sexual preferences and everyone kinda keeps to themselves so it is hard to make friends unless you join clubs.I have only been here a few months but so far there are a lot of things to do and the nearby locations are very accomdating of students and support our basketball teamI Am a Vegan.. There are not many substantial options for vegans on campus.rnSo, bring your own food to be safe!!I Got a Full-Ride.. I studied hard in high school, and received a full-ride to UTA by simply applying to the school.rnIt pays to get good grades!!I have heard good things about off-campus housing around UTA.rnThe parking appears good and convenient, and most places nearby are new and clean.Everywhere you go, you see signs that express the tobacco free campus. It\\'s in every syllabus... Fully enforced!!!Don\\'t Be Late!!! This goes for every university, college, or school... But NEVER show up late, or you\\'ll have no luck finding a spot. Early is on time, On time is late, Late is... Well...  You\\'re stuck.Almost every place around has offered discounts, or at least has coupons. Very convenient.I did search for apartments nearby, but they\\'re all out of my small budget. If I had a larger budget, I would most definitely consider staying in an off-campus housing building.Professors in the Engineering Department â€“ The professors in the engineering department are friendly and willing to help you, provided that you first help yourself. They are definitely serious when it comes to the coursework and the lectures. However, after class, most of them are quite friendly.Modern Computer Labs â€“ The computers provided for student use are kept up to date and in good working order. The students also have the choice to use either Macs or PCs, whichever their preference is. Due to the number of students, I would recommend owning and bringing your own computer to avoid the lab rush. This also gives you the option of choosing where you study or work as each building has a wireless network.Friendliest Staff I Have Ever Encountered â€“ The staff and students here are as friendly as could be asked for. Any question I had, and I did have some simple ones, they answered without any hint of impatience. During orientation, some of the graduate students there just walked up, introduced themselves and started talking about what our goal was and actually got to know us. I could tell that they were not playing a role, but were genuinely interested in what we had to say.A Car Is a Necessity in Texas â€“ Arlington does not have a public transportation system. A vehicle is a must if you plan on living in Texas, and more directly, in Arlington. As far as the transportation provided by the school...I believe they have a shuttle that will take students to Target, Wal Mart, and The Parks Mall. Of course, there is a drop off and pick up time. Overall, public transportation is horrible.Great Places If You Can Get There â€“ There are a lot of different types of restaurants around UTA. Some are chain restaurants (McDonald\\'s, Subway, Taco Bell). However, there are quite a few hidden gems. My favorite by far is a spot called Jamaican Gates. They have great Jamaican food for reasonable prices. The only down side about these hidden gems is they are not on campus, so for those students without transportation, this could be a problem because Arlington does not provide public transportation.The Best School Ever â€“ UTA is an awesome university. You have to work hard, but the professors are always available and more than willing to help students. What I like most about this university is that I don\\'t really have to leave it for anything. They offer movie night, a bowling alley, our own little mall (opening this fall), a great gym...and the grounds are beautiful. Its not much of a nightlife around here, but I\\'m not much of a party-girl, so that doesn\\'t matter much to me. I graduate in December, but I don\\'t even want to leave. My experience here has been great.Hard, but Worth It â€“ School of Architecture has a heavy workload, however it should all pay off in the end.Getting Better â€“ There are many orange-bricked plain buildings, however there have been more additions that show creativity.New College Park â€“ New College Park stadium at UTA was a great addition to campus life.Pretty Even Ratio â€“ At University of Texas at Arlington the ratio of boys to girls seems pretty even.Choice and Availability â€“ There are plenty to go around most of the time and one can use which ever type and brand they preferWhatever You\\'re Hungry for â€“ Within walking distance you can find fast food, chain eateries, bistro, bars and pizzeriasEverybody wants the close in spaces and guess what? There\\'s never enough.rnThere are a lot of people driving on campus; you\\'re not likely to find a spot and make it to class on time if you only allot 10 minutes.rnSince it isn\\'t free, it costs too much. Parking should be free right? UTA doesn\\'t think so, but they don\\'t think is should be expensive either. As cheap as $50 a year.And now that you know I feel all ooey and gooey and gushy about my school, I\\'ll spare you the tooth decay. The diversity, overall standard of excellence and faculty support for students\\' imagination, expansion and creativity make UTA a wonderful place to be.Don\\'t Think About It â€“ I\\'ve never had to seriously consider my safety at UTA. I\\'m comfortable doing what I need to do. I function at UTA much like I function everywhere else. That means I stay alert to my environment, don\\'t flash valuables or cash, the normal stuff. Its an inner city campus; so the possibility of crime exists. It happens less often than one might expect on a downtown campus and when it does, it is most often crime of opportunity.Great Greek People â€“ I have met some amazing people who are greeks and I cant wait to go greek myselfNo Football â€“ I love the fact that we do not have a football team. I came from a high school that everything revolved the football team. Our principal spent more money on that instead on academics. It is very nice to my money is being spent on the important things that matterGreat Besides the Cost of Printing â€“ The cost of printing does add up, especially if you print out powerpoints. rnFinding a computer is easy besides when it\\'s midterms and finals weeksSoooo Many Different People â€“ AMAS LASO FSA ASA KSA VSA  are just few of the orgs that are on campus that are multicultural.Get INVOLVED! By getting involved helps you learn about activities around campus.rnWe have so many things throughout the school year such Bed Races, Oozeball, MavSwap, Activity Fairs, Greek events! Never a dull moment besides during finals week.Shadowing Nurses â€“ I know internships for Nursing are mostly shadowing nurse on a typical day or volunteering at a hospital. Both are very educational so that you have an excellent chance to see things firsthand. rnI do not have any concerns in finding an internship because I speak Spanish and English. This is an amazing opportunity in order to help others because you can communicate with more people.Very Educational â€“ Nursing is one of the hardest majors on campus because the chances of getting into the nursing program is very difficult. I love nursing. I enjoy helping people so it\\'s a good major for me. The classes are hard but you have to study a lot in order to get a good grade on the tests.Very Diverse â€“ UTA is a very diverse campus. A lot of my friends that i made it was their first semester in teh USA.Not Difficult â€“ The admissions office does not make the application requirement gruesome. Once you get in you just have to get all of your forms in order and your setPretty Good â€“ There are always some sort of parties going on. Not always the best but something.Very Good â€“ There are a good variety of food off campus and very close to campus. Some of those places have student discounts but its not the majority of them.Buses Run Daily â€“ There are buses that run on a daily schedule throughout the campus on a 15-minute schedule so you can get where you need to be when you need to be there.Plenty of Places â€“ Just no money if you\\'re a college student!rnHowever, the attractions in and around Arlington\\'s campus offer all kinds of fare- from fried chicken at Babe\\'s to hot and spicy cuisine. You don\\'t have to go far to be amused, either! Ranger\\'s ballpark, Texas stadium, and six flags are all in the area.Needs Some Work â€“ The lack of a football team really shows at my school. When people pass each other on campus there is not much to be excited about. We sit in class and dream about what our futures will be like outside the four walls but don\\'t have a reason to be there other than the education.  It is also in a sketchy part of town, so that aspect at least keeps us on campus!  However, it is right next to some major amusement attractions, so if we weren\\'t all broke college students, we would probably enjoy going there!Plenty of Activity â€“ There is plenty to do around Arlington, with a Large Mall (IMAX 3D theater), Six flags Over Texas, Hurricane Harbor, Cowboys Football stadium, Texas Rangers. You will most likely not be bored with the Activities outside the University.The Unversity of Texas at Arlington is a great meeting place for all the world\\'s cultures. Your classes are at the very least going to have two or three different cultures, lifestyles, languages. If you decide to come to the school, remember to respect the life\\'s of all individuals.Off-Campus Housing is good, if you do not wait till the last minute to arrange your living situation. Be responsible.Being a Good Student â€“ As long as you study, keep active in your social activities, and keep your behavior respectable, the University of Texas is a great higher learning institution.At UTA, academics are top notch. They offer a plethora of resources such as tutoring, supplemental instruction, and group study sessions. They push academic success for everyone but especially for freshmen. They give 6 free tutoring hours to freshmen and offer special programs for STEM classes that work on acquiring successful study habits and lab techniques.School Shuttles Are Solid Choice â€“ I personally have not used the school shutttle, but I always see it around campus picking up and dropping off students from the parking lots and campus buildings. We don\\'t have public transportation in Arlington, but with the shuttle the students don\\'t need it. You either drive, walk, or take a taxi to school.The Guys and Girls Are Ok â€“ the guys and girls seem to be friendly,most of the guys are gay the school is very diverse I love it.The Food Is Pretty Tasty â€“ new to the campus so far enjoying the variety of foodsGood instructors and advisors.  We are required to pick our program of work immediately after acceptance.  This helps prevent stress during the registration process each semester because I already know what I\\'m going to take.  I can also revise it as needed if something changes.Advisors and profs are available for questions but it can be confusing when you never really meet with them.There is a wide range of majors available and the professors really seem to know their topics.  It has been frustrating for graduate school because almost the entire program has been online.  It doesn\\'t feel as supportive as my undergraduate because I don\\'t get to meet fellow students in person.The parking permit costs $130 this year and there isn\\'t convenient parking.  Plus it doesn\\'t always feel safe to park far away.  The shuttle system is nice during the day, but it would be great to have one for evening classes that get out after dark.It Was Easy but Expensive. I received my financial aid, but due to weird family conditions it was a bit of a hassle.  I also didn\\'t receive enough to cover my tuition, so I worked to cover the difference.  I still managed to finish my undergraduate degree with no student debt and I\\'m hoping to finish my graduate degree with  no debt either!The Cafe is ok. The only thing I really care to eat here are the wraps because they are made-to-order. Everything else is pretty standard cafeteria food. The Plaza is good though, with Subway, Chick-fil-a, Pizza Hut, sushi, etc.Clean School â€“ The drug use is very minimal here. not many students are involved (at least openly).There are countless ways to get involved on campus due to the high number of student organizations. Most students are pretty involved in at least 1-2 organizations.Hard, Quality Work â€“ From what I\\'ve seen of the Chemistry BS degree, the students must really prove that they can achieve the degree, even up to their last semester.Growing to Tier 1 â€“ Many new research facilities and a special events center have been constructed in the 3 yrs that I\\'ve been at UTA. Some buildings are quite old, but one\\'s of great importance are emphasized.One for All â€“ For a university in Texas, there seems to be a very wide range of ethnicity, social classes, and religions. All of these groups have their own student groups.Like Football: Come Early, Stay Late â€“ There are really only 2 lots within campus, so have your walking shoes on. Allow about 30 minutes before class to find a spot and hike. The evening isn\\'t any better because there is a huge population of evening classes.I go to school at the University of Texas at Arlington. So far, I have been very satisfied with the education I have received. I feel like this school is very organized and it is very easy to get help, which is always good. I am in the early childhood education program and love it so far!Pretty Nice â€“ Apartments are for the most part pretty nice. There are some apartments that are scary, but only a few. All of the nice apartments are decently priced and include all amenities. However, the nicer apartments fill up very quickly. You must be on a waiting list for several weeks before you can sign a lease.Nothing Special â€“ Classes are all pretty average. Not too hard but not too easy, average professors etc. There are a lot of classes to choose from which is good.Texas Heat â€“ The Texas heat during the months of May through October makes it very difficult to walk around campus comfortably. This leads to anti-social behavior by the students during these months because students seek cooler air within the residence halls or their homes.Math and Science Dept â€“ I transfered to UTA because of the strong programs in math and science.Many Ways to Get Help â€“ Professors are very helpful and gives informative assignments. No busy work.Healthcare Jobs â€“ UTA has many options for working students in Nursing program. I have been satisfied with my online instructors. It is hard to get responses from the Nursing advisors, some never respond via email or by phone. Other than the advisors busy schedule I love UTA.There is no bus line, so unless you have good friends you are stuck at school.Taxi\\'s are expensive for college students.Bureaucracy at It\\'s Finest â€“ Bureaucracy dominates the financial aid process at UTA. It requires so many documents and verifications that it is hard to keep your head straight. The way that in person appointments are handled needs to be totally revamped, there is no privacy between the students being serviced and the waiting area. I have personally witnessed 2 students yelling at the poor girl working at the front desk just because of the hassle that is involved with the financial aid office.Rent Is Too High! The on campus apartment prices are too high for what is given in return. The off campus apartments are abundant but finding an opening is like trying to find the Lost City of Gold. I\\'m just glad that there is enough parking to allow me to live in a lower rent area and just driving to campus.Fair and Safe â€“ My interactions with the campus police have be very positive. I work on campus at nights and the police have been very good at recovering stolen phones (one of the most common crimes on my campus). I was once stopped because a stolen phone\\'s GPS says that it was in my location 2 mins prior and I happened to be the only person walking by. The police approached me and were very nice throughout the stop, even talking about what they did to retrieve items when people got their property stolen. Even walking home at 3 AM, I never felt unsafe due to the high police presence in the area.Lots of History â€“ UTA\\'s campus has existed since 1895 and the architecture reflects it. The central library and the surrounding building have a very stately and distinctly southern look that reflects the long history that the campus has. The new housing buildings effectively blend the modern look without detracting from the historical structures that they surround. The activities center is state of the art and has tons of things to do ranging from swimming to basketball to rock climbing, all in the same building!SAE Program â€“ Our Formula SAE program is very well respected and has provided many students with jobs and internship opportunities that otherwise would not have been given if the SAE program did not exist. I had 3 former classmates that are currently employed at Bell Helicopters because of their knowledge that they gained participating in the program. And the best part of it all, you get to work on an awesome race car that you\\'ve helped build from scratch!Lots of Options â€“ There are so many possibilities. In walking proximity there are a taco bell, a Nizza Pizza, a Chipotle, a Wendy\\'s, a Subway, and a KFC. Arlington has so many restaurants that you can never not find food.Don\\'t Live on Canpus â€“ i don\\'t live on campus but i have been in the dorms and they are niceGirls are very pretty and come from all over the United States and the world. Guys are easy to make friends with, everyone just kind of does their own thing.Not Too Hard â€“ As long as you do your work success will come. If you are responsible and do homework and read the material college should be a breeze. The material challenges you but it is interesting at the same time.Instructors are very professional and helpful. They are always flexible even though they don\\'t have to be. Professors will work with students so they can succeed and sometimes they will even take time off their own day to help someone. I am very satisfied with the academics at UT ArlingtonNo Availability â€“ I feel like there are more cars than parking spaces. The permit costs around $150 and the only open spots are a 10 minute walk from the campus unless you get there at 7am. If  we are paying so much we should get decent parking. There is also a parking garage in which you can park but it costs 7 dollars a day or about 550 a year which is ridiculous in my opinion.Nothing special. If you come from a big city, you will become homesick. But there is six flags over texas, cowboys stadium, and parks mall.Old and Dirty â€“ They are very old houses around campus and they are not clean.  we have to call for maintenance very often. and the rent is high.Not Enough Facilities â€“ Its hard to find computers in library cause they are all taken most of the time. there are not enough computers in our lab (Psychology). printers were always crowded, but now that they have cut the budget for printing and we have to pay on our own, it became less crowdedLots of Restaurants â€“ Not having a meal plan is not problem while attending UTA. There is a wide variety of food to choose from, from American to Lebanese. Most main stream fast food restaurants are within less than a mile from the school, and most of them have discounts for studentsNo Football Team â€“ Coming from a school with a football team and having been in marching band for almost 7 years, I was surprised to learn the UTA didn\\'t have a football team. So students have to find other means of entertainment on Friday nights during the fall, though, its not diffucult, it would raise school spirit. rn    On the other hand many of the other sports on campus are excellent. Our basketball and baseball teams are greatUps and Downs â€“ I do not stay on campus, but from what I\\'ve observed, campus housing is great as far as what they offer. Most have free laundry, are furnished, their own fitness centers, cable, wifi, etc.rn    But cost is def a problem, with the cheapest being around $500/mo (separate lease). But if you take into consideration what you get in return, its fairly reasonable.I am a commuter student and very often when I arrive to school, I have to at least drive around for 20 minutes in order to find a parking spot. This situation has gotten worse over the past couple years as the school population keeps growing. To top that off, the permits cost upwards of $126. Most of the available parking is quite a distance away from many of the classrooms. With that being said, one must have a strategy in finding a parking spot. rn     One would be to arrive to campus as soon as classes start around 8am and wait it out. Not many people have morning classes. Two would be to arrive to campus just as classes are changing, but this does not guarantee being on time for class. Three would be to park off campus and risk receiving a parking ticket - one that cannot be applied to your school account.rn    I usually find that waiting it out is the most effective method. Its always better than being late or getting a ticket from the city of Arlington.RN-BSN Program â€“ I am totally happy with the online program.  I will be finished with my BSN in one and 1/2 weeks.  I have truly enjoyed taking the classes online.  I will apply for the Master\\'s program in a few months.  My goal is become a Nurse Practition.  I do not have any concerns with finding a job in this field.  There are so many openings in the health field.Online Courses â€“ I absolutely love the online courses.  I am able to complete my BSN degree and work fulltime as a RN.  The classes are usually just 5 weeks long, so they can be completed fast.  It is intense, but very doable.  The professors have been wonderful.  I am looking into pursuing my Master\\'s degree with the online program. I have been very satisfied.Girls Are Social and Outgoing â€“ UT Arlington has a diverse group of girls. You won\\'t have a problem finding someone that matches your personality and of course they are very attractive.I haven\\'t had any problems with financial aid. Going in person is probably the best way to handle issues. Email has also proven useful for me as well.Lots of Places Off Campus â€“ all around UT Arlington, there are a variety of places to dine from.So Hot in Texas â€“ Really hot when walking around campus needs more shaded areasIt\\'s Been a Process â€“ This has been confusing. I blame my parents more than the school, though.In Between It All â€“ The University of Texas at Arlington is between Fort Worth and Dallas.  There are plenty of apartments, stores, restaurants, and a couple of bars at walking distance.The Police Don\\'t Miss a Thing! Whether it\\'s parking the wrong way in a one way parking lot, or not having a parking sticker, they catch everything. I got a ticket for parking the wrong way in a one way parking lot, and it was four minutes after I remember parking-how mean to not even tell me or warn me! I\\'ve heard a lot of people getting tickets or towed cars for parking in different lots around campus.Freshman Year Was My Best â€“ I was in the Freshmen Leaders on Campus student organization, and that was the main reason why my freshmen year was so amazing and I was such an active person on campus. I was involved in almost everything I could find. i didn\\'t want to just go to school and read and do homework everynight-I wanted to also have fun and not be so bored just doing schoolwork. I loved that the student organizations are so involved in campus and around the city too. DFW metroplex has a lot of opportunities and UTA student organizations definitely take advantage of that in helping students build an active resume.Walking Is Best! Walking is your best option, because everything is so close together. Nothing is too far from everything else. The only thing is that the campus is getting a lot bigger with housing, but once you\\'re on campus five minutes is enough, and you\\'re set with walking to class and back to your dorm, unless you want to grab a bike and go around campus a little bit faster. I\\'ve seen a lot of people who long board too.Right Across the Street â€“ Trinity Hall is directly across the street from the Architecture building, which is amazingly convenient since architecture majors are up for days working on projects and having your home be across the street makes it so easy to just walk to your room for a quick nap and then come right back to studio to keep working on your projects.Campus Living â€“ I do not live on campus but it is a great experience. Living on campus provides You with the opportunity to make new friends, get involved in campus activities, and calls for more studying time.Tobacco Free â€“ Our campus is a newly tobacco free campus. The use of cigarette smoking has cut down tremendously thanks to this new policy.Men\\'s Basketball â€“ Mens basketball is one if not the most loved sport at UTA. Fans come out all the time to show their spirit and support. We even made it to the finals this past school year!!University of Texas at Arlington \\'11 â€“ There was nothing at all to complain about I loved the atmosphere and everything.University of Texas at Arlington \\'11 â€“ If I could do it over again I would I feel like I messed up in so many ways and all in all I just wasn\\'t ready. I feel like s*** because i wasted so much time and money. Yes I would love another chance. I would love to one day become a senator because I feel that no one ever makes an effort to help make things better everyone complains but is never ready to stand for what they believe is right they just let other people make their decisions for them and I want to show to the world that you can make a difference if you really have the drive.University of Texas at Arlington \\'11 â€“ I really had no one to tell me what to do on this and all I can really say is make sure you accept the grants, loans, and scholarships everywhere on your school site on the FASFA site, everywhere, and also make sure you sign the promissory note.University of Texas at Arlington \\'11 â€“ They had some good stuff but they only had like 5 restaurants not including the meal plan hall, which was a buffet, the the nasty ass starbucks they had everywhere. If I lived on campus I know for a fact it would get boring as f***.I am truly grateful at the amount of aid that I receive from UTA but the process is a bit stressful! Especially if your application gets chosen to get checked, I had to do so much to get a tax return transcript because now a copy of your income tax isn\\'t accepted! I felt very overwhelmed with this change.UT Arlington does a great job at providing its students with computer labs. Their are labs located in several buildings! At the top of my head I could tell you their are plenty of computers available at the Library, University Center, and the Business Building. UTA also offers free wifi so you can use your personal computers if you want to.Smoking Banned? Recently, UT Arlington banned smoking on its campus yet they do nothing to enforce this. I still see people walking around smoking! There is this section on UTA\\'s campus that never fails to have people smoking by it, if you walk by the area you see cigarette buds all on the floor and you are sure to get a wiff of smoke. There are signs posted that say no smoking but I have yet to see anyone enforce this.Good Variety â€“ I give off-campus dining an A because of its wide variety of restaurants! Also, their close range to the school. You don\\'t have to travel too far to get to your desired restaurant. I am aware of student discounts but I don\\'t think that the restaurants nor the school does a good job at bringing this information to the students, you really have to look for that information to find it.Campus Activities â€“ On the campus there is a club for everyone to join and the advisers are so nice to helpParking is terrible. If you want to find a spot that isn\\'t a block or more away, you have to get to campus before 8am. Otherwise you\\'ll be stuck walking!Rain and Heat â€“ Whenever it rains, it\\'s very hard to walk to the different buildings. The water collects very easily and there are tons of puddles. Also during the summer, it gets very hot. Having to walk from the back parking lot in the rain or heat is awful!Many Options â€“ There are a lot of guys on campus. There attractiveness depends on what kind of guy you like. I would say there are guys there for every type of person. And they don\\'t look bad either.The Highlands â€“ There are plenty of small places to eat in Arlington. There are many shopping centers with a wide variety of food. Many aren\\'t walking distance. As long as you have a ride good food will always be near.The Highlands is a place with many restaurants like PF Changs, BJ\\'s, and Red Robin. The foods here are relatively cheap.Labs Are Fine â€“ The computer labs are average and serve their purpose.  You can usually find an open computer and the sound level is normally manageable.Average at Best â€“ I don\\'t think students at UTA are the typical college students. Many are older, married and have kids.  They are there strictly for an education and aren\\'t interested in the typical college partying.On Your Own! UTA is a commuter college so you are pretty much on your own when it comes to off campus housing.  Also, the area around UTA has a lot of crime and usually isn\\'t somewhere a college student would want to live alone.UTA is located in an area that\\'s pretty populated, especially high school students. Its nice because its really close to stores like walmart and target, and shopping centers like the Parks Mall and other places. But Arlington doesn\\'t have a public transit, so you\\'re able to only go to places the UTA bus travels to, and they only run for a very limited time.Easy to Move on Campus â€“ During the day there are several shuttles that run on campus at a consistent schedule. At night there is a pick up program that drives students back to their dorms or car. Both of these services are free. But if you need to get off campus you are a bit out of luck. Arlington has no public transportation system. UTA attempts to alleviate this by having a shuttle that has a couple drop off points/pick up points around the city for a small fee. But stores are fairly close so if you need to leave campus I would suggest using a bike, calling a cab, or making friends with someone with a car.Although texas is known for its unreliable weather conditions it does not affect the classes timings. Because of its many green area zones we even had classes during tornadoes. Its a different situation when it snows but other than that weather has no say in the scheduling of our classes.Another Experience - Good or Bad â€“ Well I caam to UTA only because of its outstanding engineering program. The engineering professors are quite friendly  and are very supportive. Although at times they place a lot of burden on us but they are more than forthcoming in understanding our situations. Compared to the rest of the departments, hats off to engineering departments faculty, facility and study areas.Engineering Major Is Awesome â€“ I am a software engineering major and the department is worthy of praise. Infact UTA is known for its engineering program. The professors are top notch and they really have reliable contacts for job opportunities for students willing to input their 100% effort. many of the students in our department are working for companies like Amazon, Dell, Intel etcDorms Culture Fading â€“ the new dorms are awesome but some of the old ones really need some renovation. The cost is quite reasonable but the truth is that not many of the students live on campus,; many of the prefer to live in the apartments because its much cheaper there compared to the dorms. Plus the housing process takes a lot of time.The People Are Eh â€“ Everyone looks the same. But there are some good looking people around.They Are Pretty Basic â€“ The strictness of the campus is pretty basic.  If you follow the Texas laws then you should be doing alright on campus.  When you break the law then you are most likely breaking campus rules and you could be suspended or kicked out of the university.The Gym Is Amazing â€“ The gym is brand new and it is great!  The gym has all the machines you need in order to get in shape.  Not only do they have machines but they offer aerobic classes too.  The student center and library are both very clean and offer many things.  I really enjoy each facility at UTA.Good Times â€“ The University of Texas at Arlington is a great university to attend.  As long as you stay focused on school and not only your friends you are guaranteed to be successfull.  All of the professors I have had so far have been great and very knowledgeable about the course they are teaching.  If I were younger and were to choose a university to attend, I would probably choose a more popular university like the University of Texas at Austin.  Overall, the University of Texas is a great place to get your degree at.Maintaing This GPA â€“ Most greeks require a gpa minimum which keeps students on their toes ehen it comes to their grades.  I\\'ve seen several greeks do things on campus trying to raise money for chairity or student activities and organizations.  Greeks make going to school fun because they usually are having fun, offeing good food, and playing good music. If I were younger I would have definitely joined a serority.Work Hard Play Hard â€“ I would do everything again, but differently. UTA\\'s nursing program is prestigious and many of my friends got jobs while still in the program. My career goal is to become a travel nurse and I\\'m not that worried about finding a job as a nurse. Nurses are in demand.Nursing Major â€“ Being a nursing major at UTA is hard work. You not only fight to have a chance of being accepted into the program, but you need to fight to stay in. rnUTA is one of the top nursing schools in Texas and it has state of the art equipment. The school offers an on campus program and an online program.Our basketball team always does really well in the sun belt conference! (I think that is what it is called). And the workout area is huge!!!It is literally so awesome! It is rated in the top ten of most diverse universities in the nation! The people on campus are very caring and sweet. I haven\\'t met someone who is genuinely mean yet, so that\\'s a plus. The theatre is so beautiful. I live everything about it. I love UTA, so I think I would choose it again if it came down to it because, not only do I love everything about my major, but the people are really what make this school so awesome and spirited!Since my focus is strictly nursing I am not familiar with the athletics department. I also take all of my courses online which makes it difficult be involved in any sporting events.UTA at Arlington is the best choice in North Texas to continue nursing education. They offer a very flexible RN to BSN online program that is perfect for a full-time working nurse. Thanks to UTA I will finally achieve my goal in completing a Bachelor\\'s Degree in Nursing. I would definitely recommend UTA to any future students.I havent looked into finding an internship just yet, but that is definitely on my upcoming to-do list.UTA honestly has proven to be an amazing college. I couldnt have wished for anything better.I have seen the dorms of friends and theyre all pleased.Im personally not in one, but they all seem friendly enough!UTA has a great gym and facilities to do a variety of sports.UTA has taught me so much my first year.It really depends on your major, but the workload and rigor of the courses range from average to very difficult. In the classes I\\'ve taken, I have been able to learn the subjects taught, but the workload was very difficult to arrange. Time management is an important asset to have in this university. There are various areas where students can go to obtain resources or study time in order to further their knowledge.Since the University of Texas at Arlington is one of the top schools ranked in diversity, a lot of the students are pretty accepting of each other. There are many international students and students from different ethnicities and backgrounds attending the university. Everyone has been quite tolerant and accepting so far.Depending on the people that you hang out with, you don\\'t really get to be pressured into taking drugs or alcohol. There is talk about alcohol among students, but it\\'s really private.Before I attended the University of Texas, I grew up in a very conservative, small, Texas city where the majority of people looked and acted the same. Although, by coming to UTA I have been exposed to an amazing array of cultures, people, and ideas. I was very timid and uneasy about this change in the beginning, but eventually, I realized that I had an amazing amount of opportunity to change my narrow views on the world. Although I hold my conservative values with a strong will, I am proudly more open to other ways of life. I may not necessarily agree with the actions or beliefs of others, but I am no longer quick to judge and shame. With UTA being the 5th most diverse college campus in The United States of America, anyone truly has a unique opportunity to succeed here.  rnrnAdditional to learning new social skills, I have quickly realized I am very fortunate to attend a university that shows true passion about the department of my major. I have a surplus of tools, world-renowned professors, and labs at my convenience to help me succeed in finishing my civil engineering degree. rnrnWhen I graduated from Harrell a year early in 2014, I saw coming to UTA as a boring 4-year long sentence rather than an opportunity; I now realize that between my Alpha Chi Omega sorority sisters, academics, and friends throughout campus are none the less a blessing I would do again in a heartbeat.It looks fun, they have a lot of events to go to and the housings are all on Greek Rowwe have such a great support for our teams at the school, people show up every timeIt makes a lot of us feel at home especially most of us being far away from homeI believe that this school has a  lot of opportunities to help students transition into their careers. The fact that the staff has been so helpful thus far makes me feel like I have the support to help me advance. Everyone has been encouraging, and has provided me with the information needed to ensure I have a smooth transition into this university.  My advisor has already got my whole schedule together to make sure I\\'m on the right track to completing and achieving the degree I have been seeking. With this degree I can then move on  into the career path I\\'ve always dreamed.I have just transferred to the University of Texas Arlington so I can\\'t really give to much of an opinion about what I think about the school, and it\\'s professors. I will say thus far I\\'ve had a great experience just dealing with my advisor in my department,  and whenever I\\'ve had a question as far admission goes, and dealing with the staff in the admission and records office everyone has been nothing but helpful and nice. So that makes me excited about going to this school, and completing a degree in exercise science.All of my classes were very diverse in terms of class size and style of professor. My only complaint is that I didn\\'t like how strict a few professors were.Signing up for classes can be a headache. It\\'s basically a free for all and once classes are full you\\'re out of luck. But, the teachers here are amazing. They\\'re very knowledgeable in their subject and I have loved the T.A.\\'s that I\\'ve had so far. There are also different types of classes you can take such as T/TH, MWF, once a week classes, and there\\'s even online classes.Mixed Review â€“ The people on campus dress nice, they don\\'t go out looking like they just rolled out of bed. The gym is a popular spot especial for the sorority and fraternity people. Most people are friendly and the campus is very diverseJust Noise at Night â€“ The apartments have thin walls but I still love living here.No Drugs â€“ I\\'ve witnessed a teacher telling a student to not smoke on campus.  And hasn\\'t seen someone smoke since then.School Is Awesome â€“ I would like to continue my education at University of Texas at Arlington because it is the one shool that has all my needs and want for my career for the future.  Great teachers and such a friendly place.Experienced Professors in Landscape Architecture â€“ The professors within the Lanscape Architecture department are all very well educated and have a diverse professional background. Regardless of the specialization within the field that a student chooses to go into, there is at least one professor that has experience within that field. The professors are generally helpful and knowledgable about their courses and subjects.Activities Center â€“ Sports are not a central aspect of life on UTA campus. The Maverick Activity Center (MAC) is the gym on campus and is an excellent facility. It houses two indoor running tracks, climbing wall, bad mitton courts, weight and cardio centers, basketball courts, dance facilities, a commuter students lounge, and many other amenities.The overall outward look of campus is dynamic. The buildings are all constructed of matching brick and steps have recently been taken to improve housing, recreation, and environmental efforts on campus. Unfortunately the campus is unbalanced in their priorities. Buildings such as the new engineering building have been recently renovated and are state of the art. This is because of the importance the engineering department has to the school. This priority is not evenly distributed across the campus. Buildings such as the Architecture Building are not cleaned or repaired with equal importance to others. They are missing such simple priorities as lightbulbs in classrooms. The school needs to make more of an effort to equally distribute their funding and care across the campus regardless of the popularity of the major housed within the buildings.Police Always Present â€“ More recently UTA has increased the police presence so it\\'s pretty safe. There are a good amount of police call stations for emergencies and they will escort you to your car if you ask them to. That said, some of the further parking lots are very dark and scary at night.More of a Commuter School â€“ UTA is not really a party school.. There are frats and sororities but it\\'s more of commuter school with an older crowd of students. There\\'s a few bars cli to campus but they are older and not always busy.. Might as well skip the Arlington scene and go to Dallas or Fort Worth.Music Is the Way to Go! I absolutely love being a music major at UTA! My music classes are the best part of my days at school and I really enjoying participating in band an orchestra.Theft and Shady Places â€“ I had never witnessed theft before coming to UTA, but I have seen three bike\\'s stolen on various occasions throughout the school year. A close friend of mine even got grabbed and pulled into the forest near the MAC before Christmas Break. I don\\'t feel safe walking alone especially at night.Teachers Have Become My Close Mentors â€“ Never in my career as a student have I felt so inspired and closely supported by my college professors. They have even gone so far as to give me their personal cell phone numbers and invite me to Thanksgiving dinner at their house when I had no where to go. I love going to class because the professors care so much about each and every student as well as the coursework they present.It\\'s Above Average â€“ Although I don\\'t like everything about the school it is still pretty good. Not all teachers are that good and barely anyone likes the math department. Still good to go to though.I\\'m white, and I\\'d say that there is just as many people of other ethnicities as there are white. Although religion isn\\'t as expressed as much as other things, there is still more than just Christianity around campus. The male to female ratio is about equal.More Than I Expected â€“ They have more things available to me than i expected. I love the library tons of resources!Many Options â€“ I have decided to live off campus because i am starting college a little later than most. But i did appreciate all the options for on campus living! i had no idea they had so many complexes on campus.Great Variety â€“ The meal plans are decently priced for what you get. There is also a great variety of regular food and specialty food.i dont hangout with the party scene but i do hear more about the drinking than anything else.Extremely Diverse â€“ UTA has alot of international students so we have a little bit of everything.Good Amount â€“ I received enough financial aid to help me pay for tuition, books and my living situation.The shuttle runs throughout the week around campus and there are special little stops around campus where you can wait for it where it arrives at one every 15 minutes.Gym Is Amazing! The MAC or Maverick Activities Center is a state of the art, beautiful and newly built gym and recreation center. It has all of the weight and exercise machines you can think of, indoor rock climbing wall, indoor soccer field, indoor and outdoor basketball courts, indoor running track, indoor and outdoor volleyball courts,racquetball courts, badminton courts, pin pong tables,indoor and outdoor pool, locker rooms for your personal belonging and showers, special rooms for workout classes like Zumba and Pilates, computer area with printers aside, small market with energy drinks and snacks.Not Noticeable â€“ I haven\\'t seen any evidence of drug use on campus.There are many restaurants to try that are in walking distance from the college. The only problem is facing traffic.Good Internship Opportunities â€“ There are plenty of internship opportunities available. They work around your schedule and give decent pay. I was an intern at a botanical research institute and I can only presume that this internship will be able to get me the connections I need in life. They provide you with enough responsibilities during your work day that keep you busy.Not Many Options â€“ Arlington in general doesn\\'t have public transportation so going long distances would be hard, but you could always call a taxi. The school has transportation that will take you from your dorm/apartment to the main campus or recreational fields. School transportation doesn\\'t run 24/7. Your best bet would be to either have your own car or become friends with someone who drives if you want to be able to get around Arlington.Dallas is very near and the nightlife there is amazing. You will never get bored in Dallas. For fun around Arlington, become friends with people who throw house parties. There are always parties it just depends on who you know. Clubs aren\\'t plentiful in Arlington.The parking area gets really fully in the mornings. You would have to come to class maybe 30-45 mins before your class starts. However, there has been a newly added parking garage and with the construction of new apartments for the next school year I am sure that there will be an increase in parking availability.Communications for a Reason â€“ As a communications major at UT Arlington, they know that we choose communications because we are socially talented. You\\'re only required to take 2 college level math and science classes, which is amazing. I\\'m terrible at those 2 subjects so it really helps me out. UTA is in the middle of the 5th largest television and radio markets so it\\'s a great location to gain experience.Need More â€“ The Parking on campus is horrible.  You really need to get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class starts to find a spot, and once you do, you need to hurry up, because chances are, you are already late for class.Getting Better â€“ Nightlife @ UTA is getting better for those that can enjoy it.  They have recently spruced up the place and added an on campus bar and small shopping center.  Things are looking up for sure.  There are tons of entertainment centers around the campus, Six Flags, The Rangers and The Cowboys stadium.Very Smooth â€“ My financial aid experience was very smooth. All i had to do was to fill in my fafsa and it only took about three days until i got my response and information.Absolutely Divers! There are so many races at UTA. I\\'ve seen many Arabs, Asians, whites, African Americans, Persians, and many other races. It\\'s just absolutely divers!So Many Things to Pick from â€“ At UTA, there\\'s always something to do. whether it\\'s on campus like university related activities or off campus. There\\'s always a basketball game, many places to shop at, gyms, six flags, good restaurants, and it\\'s close to home so i can always visit.The Engineering Research Facility Is Great! The Facilities at UTA are awesome with many labs and resources. The building is designed to help the environment since it incorporates energy-saving features like green roofs and ways to capture water and store it for landscape use. It\\'s a really good environment to learn and explore.Alcohol Doesn\\'t Help Students Learn â€“ Alcohol is accessible by students.  They don\\'t need it.  They need to study.The parking is okay if you get there a reasonable amount of time before class. If you don\\'t you might have trouble finding somewhere to park.Around Town â€“ If you go out and explore the nightlife you\\'ll have fun.Online RN to BSN (Nursing) â€“ Except for Nursing Research and Vulnerable Populations most of the information in this program was a repeat of my ADN program. Though I have a high GPA, I will say it was difficult. Not because the information was challenging (I have learned most of it before), but because of the shear number of little writing assignments hidden in strange pockets throughout their system. I see frequent posts of students saying they didn\\'t see an assignment and begging for an opportunity to complete it late. The answer is always no.rnrnI am lucky that I learn best out of a book. Other than prerecorded lectures, access to the instructor is forbidden. People can only email or post forum questions to the \"academic coach\". These coaches are not employees of UTA, but contracted by a company called StateU.com, or subcontracted from some other nameless corporation. If students ask coaches about confusing points on nursing topics, they are referred back to the text. If they ask the coach to clarify foggy requirements for an assignment, the coach refers them back to the assignment instructions. Almost every email I sent to a coach was replied to with an email that might have been cut-and-pasted from another source. It\\'s like chatting with IBM customer support.Online RN to BSN (Nursing) â€“ Really, the only thing you need to get into this program is apply, transfer credits and pay the tuition. However, once you are in the RN to BSN program, you are stuck in a degree mill program doing strangely difficult busy-work for the following 13 months.Bad With Sports â€“ This school is only good for its basketball team. Everything else isnt really heard off. Joining a fitness/health class for non-academic purposes are expensive. If UTA wants us to be healthy lower the prices please!Alright School â€“ It has been okay coming to school here. UTA is not really a known school except that it has a good nursing program. It has no football team which lowers its rank upon other universities.Police Enforcement Lack â€“ There are way too many posting on crimes that happen throughout campus. There should be more polices walking around. Guys going around slapping butts even in daylight and then run off.Usually there\\'s always a computer to use unless it\\'s during lunch time where most people don\\'t have classesDrugs aren\\'t very big at UTA. Usually just drinking or smoking cigarettes. Some smoke pot.Legs Exercise Is Uncalled for â€“ College parking sometimes makes me regret having a car. Starting with a overly expensive parking stickers, i always become very anxious of parking tickets. I once got a parking ticket for a ridiculous reason. The reason was because i parked my car in the same direction as the car that was behind mine instead of facing another car on the other side. Of course i didn\\'t make the same mistake to get a ticket. Also, i always have to make sure i get to school 30 minutes before my first class to find a parking spot. I\\'m sure i will get used to it as i become a sophomore.Tobacco Free Campus â€“ One thing i really like about our campus is that UTA is Tobacco Free Campus. The signs are everywhere throughout the campus and you rarely see people smoking upfront. Also there are always security guards or police officers walking around to secure the campus.Unforeseen Greek Clubs\\' Activities â€“ As any other Greek organizations at universities, a lot of students are involved in Greek life, so are called Fraternities and Sororities. As a non-Greek student, i heard of what they do in those societies, such as crazy parties and drinking. However i recently came across with the realization of Greek students\\' unforeseen activities. This one frat guy in my Theatre&Film class made an announcement with the professor\\'s permission. He was wearing a nice suit and had some $1 bills pinned on his chest and i thought to myself, he is probably announcing that there will be a huge party for his birthday or something. Contrary to my expectations, he shyly began to speak about the awareness for raising money for the kids\\' birthday who are facing financial struggle. This changed my perception of Greek influence on our campus. They also come out in the University Center or Plaza to spice up the tedious atmosphere and entertain the students to get together. there are Greek organizations such as, Delta Sigma Theta, Gamma Sigma Alpha, and Kappa Alpha Order.The on campus housing at UTA is average at best. The current housing is very old and broken down. Recently though, the campus has begun building new apartments which are in great condition, so there is improvement in the on campus housing.There are plenty of food choices off campus for students. You can find student discounts almost anywhere and the location of the majority of the restaurants are just a few miles down the road.Here at UTA we rarely have health or safety issues. Although this campus is enormous in size, the campus crime police do a stand-up job in dealing with various issues and keeping everyone safe.Sports Are Not That Big Here â€“ I hear the basketball team is pretty good, I wish we had football being that we have an unused stadium just sitting there.appartments all around, no public transportation so you\\'ll need a carGood Professors? When I was in the pre-nursing program, I endured professors that love the subject, but horrible at teaching. They say to study one thing, but then test over material that was not gone over heavily.A Commuter School â€“ A majority of students drive to school on their own accord. there is a bus system, but it is only use if you park way over on the stadium side. At night, though, they have a system to take students from place to place on campus if needed so students don\\'t have to walk alone at night.The frats and sororities are very involved with campus life. There are only a handful though that have houses of their own.all financial aid that i obtained was thru my high school... now some scholarships did not have enough funds so now i dont have enough moneyJust Be Alert â€“ Every now and then you get a crime alert about someone approaching a young lady walking by herself at night, but people, especially young women, need to be extremely cautious when walking by themselves at night.Perfect Mix â€“ You have Cowboys Stadium, Ballpark in Arlington, Six Flags, and Hurricane Harbor all within a 5 mile range. There are fast food restaurants and local bars in walking distance of the campus.it is really good we have a cafe and plaza plenty of optionsCampus Crime â€“ there has been a couple of incidents caused to a couple of studentsIts Good â€“ The nightlife is amazing and the city is so alive at night.Alcohol here is very well monitored and not abused that oftenReally Diverse â€“ This campus is one of the most diverse campuses i\\'ve ever been toI Feel Safe â€“ The police system here at UTA is a well department. If i call them they respond at quick timesGreeks Are Amazing! There are a lot of greek houses on campus. Greeks basically run campus which shows how committed the students are to social life within school.It\\'s Okay â€“ There are a lot of things to do but after a while it loses it\\'s excitement. Although the campus just got a new gym which is amazing and fun... The dallas cowboys cheerleaders came and the rapper drake. :)all the facilities on campus are well taken care of.It\\'s Great Here â€“ If you like the city then this place is great for you. There is always something to do on and off campus. There are always great concerts and events for the students. Its not too big or too small of a campus.Everyone\\'s Average â€“ There are all variety of girls and guys here. Some are hot and some are not. It just depends on your taste. It seems like most girls and some guys i meet are in Soroities or Fraternities.Apartments Are Average â€“ There are both expensive and cheap apartments, but you get what you pay for. If you want a nice modern apartment, it will cost you, but if you dont mind not having all the pizazz, then it\\'s affordable. I have noticed that most apartments are really old because of the rate at which technology is advancing, but they are building more modern apartments around the city. I think the only con of living in off-campus housing is the commute and being away from all the on capmus activities.Places to Eat â€“ There are a number of places to eat near the UTA campus.  You have a choice of Chicken from Kfc, fish from Long John Silvers Cajun Corner if you have a taste for spicey food.  Tacos from Taco Bell. Starbucks is close to the campus.  Chili\\'s is down the street.So you do have a variety of choices.The school campus shuttles are constantly running so if you miss one there will be another one soon.  They are relatively fast and heated. UTA is a commuter campus and there is not enough parking and tons of traffic around campusCampus Centers â€“ Very few of the buildings are run down, and there is a newly built parking garage.  UTA also recently finised a new gym for the basketball team.  The MAC gym at UTA is also very nice looking.There are numerous computer labs but printers tend to not work or make low quality prints. There is also a charge for printing and it is more effecient to just buy your own.  The wireless internet is fast but sometimes has trouble connecting to computers.There are a lot of 21+ bar/grills and dive bars in arlington, which is right up my ally, but since Arlington isn\\'t really a \"college town\" the drink prices are pretty standard as opposed to other places where they have dollar beer nights and what not. There are very few 18+ clubs, and for good reason- its dangerous. Cowboys is a death trap for underages, fights every night, drugs and sexual misconduct out the wazoo.BRING YOUR PEPPER SPRAY â€“ Due to the terrible parking situation and the surrounding dangerous neighborhood, it has become the norm for students (myself included) to carry some form of protection. We get regular emails from the university police weekly about someone who was attacked/mugged/or even almost abducted.not really sure how the transportation works, I usually drive thereComputer Labs â€“ there are many computer labs, especially in the library, the network liability and speed is great, the librarian is very helful and you ask all the questions you want if you need helpit is very stressful because you are trying to hardest to keep up with your grades, we mostly needs A\\'s in order to get accepted into the nursing program. the workload is normal I guess everywhere you go and whatever it it that you are trying to major in you will have alot of assignments to do. the nursing building is the best, it has great places to study the staff is very friendly and help with whatever you have questions with.Underage Life â€“ there is to much underage drinking and partying that lead to pregnancy and other thingsThere is so much diversity whoch allows each student to explore different culture and society.Parking Garage Security â€“ I feel they should have more patrol on foot around the parking garages especially at night.Not a Big Deal â€“ The local weather is sometimes strange, you never know how the next day will feel like, but buildings at the University are very close to each other so the weather is not a big deal.The Best It Could Be â€“ I am really happy with the schools network and accessible computers as well as printers.Glad I\\'m Here â€“ I had considered transferring after my first semester, but after joining a fraternity, getting involved, and having great econ professors, there is no way I\\'m leaving this place until I graduate.Greeks Own the College Experience â€“ I waited a year and got really involved at UTA before deciding to go Greek and there is a huge difference.  Greeks are way more involved and have way more school spirit than most students.School Spirit on the Rise â€“ Everyone complains about the lack of a football team.  Our wheelchair basketball team is one of the best in the nation and those games are ridiculously exciting.  The new sports center is fantastic and students are getting more and more proud of our sports program.School Policies â€“ The school has some pretty strict rules when it comes to parking. many students here get parking tickets for no reason. Overall I think that the safety of the students is very important so having security is a good thing.There are many different people at UT Arlington, which is why it is a great campus. There are people from different social classes. Guys range from city boys, country guys, fraternity guys, rich guys, middle class guys. Many interest for guys here at UTA include joining a fraternity or a sports team. Similar to the guys, girls can vary here. Some girls are very classy, others are very nice and outgoing, and some can be a little rude. Overall the we have a pretty great student body.The University is a great place to get an education. Not only does it offer many degrees including some doctoral, it also has a great faculty/staff. Many of the professors here have the highest degree on their field. The student body is very diverse and it creates a great atmosphere. The registration process can be a little stressful and time consuming but it the counselors are very helpful when needed. The amount of work depends on the professor but it is usually a good amount. UT Arlington offers many tutoring options to help students be successful. Some of the tutoring programs include math, the writing center, and private tutors. There are many places to hang out with friend or when someone needs to study. The University Center has great study lounges, the library has a study hall, and there a quiet rooms around campus like the one in University Hall. I came to Arlington because I got into CAP at UT Austin. I decided to stay at UT Arlington because I realized that the science school was great .It\\'s Okay â€“ I like the people and some of the classes in other departments, but the art part of this school is terrible and the advisers are just evil.There isn\\'t very much involvement of the sororities and fraternities on campus. It\\'s a joke.Somewhat Safe â€“ I am just the kind of person who won\\'t be seen anywhere at night alone. I hate going places alone as it is. I do not walk on campus after dark alone and I refuse to sign up for late classes. I am so scared something is going to happen and there are always bulletins of robberies on campus and crimes around campus. Everything is always lit but I still am scared.More Drinking Than Doing Drugs â€“ Arlington is really small, there is not too many places to visit on the weekends so most of the people drink here a lot.The safety and security features is really tight and secure. I never have felt unsafe on Arlington campus.Why I Would Choose It â€“ UTA has the best tuition rates in North Texas for a UniversityThe area near the campus has many options to eat, most are inexpensive and quick servicePrinting on Campus â€“ The printing system was recently changed and students are now charged to print, whereas before there was a set amount already placed in each students accountbuses are an option if you want to mess with the schedules and waiting. bikes are a very good option if you have to park far away and get to class on time or if you live close to campus.with a fairly active greek life, there are parties available to go to. the bar scene is good for 21 and up, lots of restaurants and bars and strictly bar venues with music and good deals for college studentsThe available parking on campus is based on the time.The diversity on the UTA campus is a \"melting pot\" of races, and each race also  gets along well with each other.Um what transportation? Never heard much information about it, ive seen one or two small shuttles...There are usually computers available for use, not really much of a problem there. The computers only get crowded during certain times like the middle of the semester or the end such as for tests. I dislike that you can only print if you have money on your card, cant pay on the spot or something like that.Well, it goes for the same at most colleges. However, if i were to point on a specific drug/alcohol usage, it\\'d be beer and wine. It is not really bad, but when it gets in the way of studying with a study group or area, that\\'s when things get hectic.Ehh, I have quite a few who attend Arlington and they all say it is well, they are content. This means to me, they are not satisfied, but good enough to be content. Some are quite expensive, others, well not so good. Most apartment areas and landlords WILL absolutely raise the price for first year students.I\\'ve never really been on campus for housing, but visiting friends and family in the area, I would say from the looks of it, nice and well done. The atmosphere is mind-blowing and the spacing looks excellent.There are a lot of 18+ bars around because I guess they know that 18 year olds like to go out too. There is Cowboys Arlington which has country nights as well ship hop nights so it goes out to many people and suits many different people. There are a few bars down a street away from UTA that are very popular. Other than that we all go to the Ft. Worth Stockyards and hang out there or a lot of people go to bars in Dallas. It also helps having fraternities right here because they go out all the time.We have multiple athletic programs here at UTA, something for everyone. We have a boys and girls basketball team, volleyball, softball, baseball, swimming, and more. We have a cheer squad who wins first at nationals every year and a Dance team. For people who don\\'t have a lot of time but love to dance there is a dance class that performs at the end of each semester. I was a member of the Dance team my freshman year and we danced at every single game. I am now a member of the Dance Ensemble and perform every semester. At each game there is so much support and spirit. So many students dress up and paint themselves or scream their heads off for our team.So Many Options Here on Cooper Street! There are so many options available to choose from. There are a number of Starbucks close by as well as two locations on campus. There are many fast food restaurants available like Jack in the Box, Sonic, Taco Bell, Taco Bueno, and Chipotle. If you dont like any of those, you can check out the dining area in the Parks Mall which is only 5 minutes down the street where they have many Italian and Mediterranean food restaurants, Chik-fil-A, Sonic, Charley\\'s, and a cupcake store, as well as many well-known restaurants around the area such as Red Lobster, In-N-Out, and IHOP. If that doesn\\'t satisfy you, there is a Super Target and Walmart where you can go buy your own food to make. Also, most of these places give student discounts if you show ID. My favorite place is the Steak-n-Shake where they have great burgers for cheap.Biggest Drug Is Energy Drinks â€“ I don\\'t know what the drug scene is around campus, but drinking is always number one. However, monster drinks etc....seem to be everywhere all the time.Not Your Typical College Town. Town came way before college and although there is plenty to do, it is spread a distance across areas of town. However, growth and new construction is helping with college life atmosphere. A positive is that you are between two great cities with lots to do Ft. Worth and Dallas.One of Thousands â€“ I am a part-time commuter student. I have found that Science classes required for Nursing major are LARGE with little to no choice in times/days of availability. There are SO many pre-nursing and pre-med students that you would think there would be more classes available to accommodate. This translates to distance between you and the professor because there are just so many people at the office after class waiting for a turn to talk with him/her.The campus police or security will help students if its too late at night.I have seen students getting a ride in the campus vehicle t their parking lots or bulidings if they feel unsafe at night.Good School â€“ UTA is a good public university.The professors and advisors are helpful.The campus is clean and overall environment is great.I love UT Arlington.Im Content â€“ Im very content with the program that i am in. I feel that the instructors are very thorough in their course work presentation.I can always find a parking spot right outside the building that my first class is in and all my other classes are in the surrounding buildings. I cant complain.Exercise Science â€“ Being an exercise science major at UTA is pretty cool. I plan on doing Physical Therapy post college, and here at UTA, most of our models of my science classes are state of the art and very awesome to handle. I work load is not too bad, typical college workload.Small but Holds a Big Punch â€“ Greek Life at UT Arlington is small in numbers, but that does not stop them from raising money and being known on campus. There are only a handful of sororities and twice as many, if not more, fraternities. Each has their own philanthropy event that draw in people from all over and they come in numbers. Greek Life continues to grow and expand and will hopefully one day return to the way it was in the 80\\'s, where majority of campus was Greek.Gotta Drive to Attend â€“ The nightlife within Arlington suffers due to the long distances between bars. If a student does not drive it is hard to attend. Most of the time bars overcharge for drinks and house parties attract more people. Plus they are free, no need to bring alcohol, and usually are at a Fraternity house so its walking distance for most students.Hard Work Pays Off â€“ I came to UT-Arlington to study architecture, not knowing the work load that it involved. While the work load is overwhelming at times, and professors can be harsh, the hard work did pay off. Classes outside of studio work were enjoyable because discussion of ideas was promoted.Not Too Many Scholarship â€“ As being a business student, the business department of UT Arlington does not have that many scholarships to give away. Every year there is only few and it is really tough to get them. Unless you already have a scholarship when you transfer, otherwise it is pretty much impossible to get a scholarship while studying at UT Arlington. My best advice try to have a scholarship before you start your career at UT Arlington.There Is Nothing to Do Here â€“ Arlington city is a small city, and there is nothing to do here. Most people goes to either Dallas or Forth Wort as most fun places are located there.Girls Are Friendly â€“ You will find all sorts of guys and girls at Arlington city. The whole city is quite diversified when it comes to people. The girls around here are pretty friendly but most of the girls going to college tend to live in other places as Arlington have not many places to go to.Intramural Sports/Activities â€“ Flag football team, would be considered the mot popular.I live at home, therefore I am unsure of the housing conditions at UTA.I have not come into any problems when it comes to parking, but I also don\\'t have a car and try to walk to most of my classes.I would rate the drug and alcohol enforcement at a 6/10.New and Cutting Edge â€“ UT-Arlington campus continues to add world class and cutting edge technology with every new building it adds to campus.its good living on campus. my parents were not able to afford a dorm but i did have the opportunity to stay with friends some nights and i really thought it was a safe and friendly environment. I would personally recommend.Its a 20 minute drive to school and another 20-30 minute search for a parking space! For the price of the permit being about 120 there needs to be more availability. Also one day I drove my father\\'s car because the school supplies I needed did not fit in my tiny car when I spoke to the officers about the fine they gave me for not having a permit on that car, they still made me pay for it although I do have a permit!There Is Everything!! You can find just about any restaurant within a 5 minute drive. Ranging from all ethnicity and all price ranges.Night Time Lighting Should Be Increased. On occasion I receive e-mails describing a recent crime on campus which does frighten me a bit, especially when I stay at school into late hours of the night doing projects. The lighting at the school while kept dim, to I don\\'t know maybe make it look nicer and pretty is dangerous. I do wish there were more lamps and brighter bulbs because there are so many spaces around campus that are very dark and you would not be able to tell if there is anyone hiding around.This univeristy has such a diverse selection of people. Every person looks different and has something different to offer.There are many different places to eat. There are pretty cheap and have dollar menus.I Don\\'t Know â€“ I am in the dorms and plan to be in on campus apartments next yearThe greek life on our campus is almost non existant. There are NO \"divine nine\" sorrorities on the yard, except for the SGRho\\'s. Everyone else is either suspended or non existant. And as for our Frats, the Alpha\\'s are on top because of all the parties they throw. As for everyone else......they\\'re rarely even talked about.There are many options for off campus housing. The apartments that are expensive are either not worth it or the lease is for a whole year instead of just the academic year. All of the apartments have their pros and cons.Very Safe â€“ Anytime there is an incident that has happened on campus or near campus we recieve a crime bulletin. This helps make the campus feel like a safer environment.The campus life is awesome. You are able to meet more  and be involved in more groups and organizations. UTA is very diverse and its hard not to meet people everyday.There are five dorm buildings and they are currently building another one for Fall 2012. All the dorms are great in their own way: Arlington Hall have the bigger rooms and great all over , KC Hall is known for the study dorms, Brazos, Lipscomb, and Trinity is known for social and more community. KC hall is the highest cost at 597 and Brazos is the cheapest at 279.If you\\'re looking for that bustling college friendly town, then you\\'ll more than likely find Arlington boring. the downtown near the school is just...a disgrace. Dallas && Fort Worth are just a drive away if you\\'re willing to make that though.Decent Selection but Not a Simple Walk Away. There are actually quite a few good restaurants off-campus but their not necessarily a walk away so you\\'ll need a car to get to most of them. The best place to find a restaurant to eat out at is the Arlington Highlands which is about a 5-10 minute drive off-campus. They have places such as Pluckers, Dave && Busters, Genghi\\'s Grill, Mexican food, Italian food, Asian food....pretty much just about any kind of food you could be in the mood for.Academics are cool. A lot of professors really are there to help you if you just take the steps to receive it. The thing I don\\'t like is there isn\\'t a lot of course variety to me. I mean they try to add a little spice to their classes but it could definitely use some improvement.Have to Love It! Arlington is probably one of the best locations to place a University. With the Texas Rangers and Cowboy stadium close by, the city is always packed with new and interesting people and going to sports bars on game nights is one of the most exciting experience i\\'ve had. Another great attraction close by is Six Flags over Texas. I don\\'t think I have ever gotten so much use out of my season pass there! I love living in arlington and I would gladly recommend this school and location to anyone.Internship and Scholastic Opportunities â€“ Aside lectures that students are given on subject areas, it is important to expose them to hand-on experience in the field, this is more achieved from internship opportunities. As an Engineering major, I will like to partake in internship programs especially during Summer. UT Arlington college of Engineering has a great  career center which helps students in finding a place. Later in the semester I plan to speak with a career counselor at the center which will put me through and guide me on how to go about getting a summer internship in a company that will meet my qualifications and interest.rnUT Arlington as a research institution and very good Engineering program makes very good effort to encourage scholarship and make various funding available for graduate studies and research, I am a beneficiary of one of such and it is an encouragement on motivation to learning.Parking on UT Arlington campus is usually difficult from 9.00pm. There are not enough parking spaces compared to number of cars, but the authority is making good efforts as new parking garages are constructed from time to time. There\\'s no public transport system in the city of Arlington which makes it necessary for each student, members of faculty and staff to have their own cars, which on the other hand also create a need to parking lots to serve this need. Members of faculty and staff usually stand better chances of parking because of more available parking lots open to them in the school premises; students on the other hand has less advantage of parking and it may take sometimes at peak hours to locate a place to park. Parking in the wrong car park does attract a fine of $20UT Arlington is located in Arlington which is the 50th largest city in the United states. The school is a public comprehensive  teaching and research institution. The city is semi-urbane in the heart of the Dallas Forth-worth metropolex, ambiance in the city is cool and encourage studies at both at baccalaureate and graduate levels. Depending on an individual, the city will fit so much for different types of people from fun-loving to nerdish individuals, with clubs around to socialize and reading facilities to encourage learning.rnCity of Arlington is home of the Dallas cowboys and Texas rangers, which makes it a hub of sport in Texas and the country at large. The city of Arlington is safe for living and studies with crime rate below average national crime rateI have to give props to UTA\\'s financial aid office. I heard from a couple of my friends who applied for financial aid about how UTA gave them more than enough money to head out for college- which is excellent. UTA\\'s financial aid office is rather quick with its procedures and rarely do you have to wait for an extended amount of time to receive your money. Well done.UT Arlington like many public colleges also has their own designated transportation bus that runs all day long to get students from one end of the campus, to the other. All \"waiting\" locations have a nice bench and a roof while you wait and the bus has a more \"modern\" feel- very comfortable and convenient. Not many students take advantage of the bus 9probably because the school is not really that large). If a student ever feels threatened, they have the option to ride with a local police officer to get to his or her apartment complex or any other spot. I believe the UTA bus is free which is even more convenient. HOWEVER, what I do not like is how the city of Arlingtion does not have any form of public bus transportation (besides some bus that takes you to the Dallas Cowboys Stadium. Since Alrington does not have a public bus transportational service, it makes is inconvenient for students and older adults who cannot drive.The School Newspaper informs students about recent crime activity around the campus and advices students to report crimes- even the slightest ones. There are \"emergency\" buttons all around the campus- so those are pretty useful for students who feel threatened at night. The school also hosts meetings with UTA\\'s police chief and speak on current safety issues and what to do in case of an emergency. At orientation, studenta are given a large manual that deals with safety precautions and the like. There has been many reported thefts WITHIN the campus (like several laptops were stolen within a few months), so they need to omprove that. What I noticed is the lack of cameras? My high school had cameras all over the place, yet I have not seen a single security camera latched anywhere around campus- perhaps an investment on that could assist with fighting off crimes. Since I live off-campus, I cannot give an accurate description if I feel \"safe\" in this college campus, but I suppose the area isn\\'t so bad after all.Drugs isn\\'t really the problem, not really big since everybody in college is somewhat getting mature. Just drinking on the weekends mostly at parties too.There are many sports that many people can do, we don\\'t really have a football team there, so not much school spirited going on, just frat groups and their parties. I know that we have basketball, tennis courts, swim team, triathlon, baseball, soccer, and many more sports.The school is a great big university, has a great engineering and nurse program. If you go to class and pay attention, getting to know the professor better than you basically pass the class.It Gets Old â€“ The cafe food is pretty much the same everyday so it gets old and you end up spending your money elsewhereNumber 1 Nursing School â€“ We have the #1 nursing school in Texas it is competitive but worth the while.Where Is the Party â€“ There is really no parties on campus, and if they are they are super lame. You can make the night fun with the people you hang out with.Not Looking for Husband Come Here â€“ The African American male population is relativity low, so I doubt I will find my husband here. There is a major population of Asians and Indians, so if your into that UTA is the place to bePolitical Science, Pre-Law â€“ It\\'s fairly easy to get into my program. You have to establish a strategic study plan to endure all of the reading but those who have work ethic should be able to be very successful in my program.Chicken Express and Babe\\'s Chicken â€“ The restaurant , Chicken Express, provides a welcoming staff that supports our University. The provide student discounts to all students as long as they come prepared with a student I.D. This is very helpful and generous because is expensive and every penny saved counts. In retrospect, all college students are thankful to restaurants like Chicken Express that provide these privileges. Another place that offers great dining is Babe\\'s Chicken. The staff and over-all atmosphere are very welcoming. The food is excellent and cooked home-style so as a customer you don\\'t get the feel of eating at a restaurant but rather eating at home with family and friends. Most college students appreciate this attribute due to the lack of home cooking on college campus\\'.Education Program â€“ The Education program at UTA is amazing. It\\'s one of the best in the nation. The staff is fun and nice, and have connections for internships and future jobs. And the classes are fun and entertaingAmazingly Awesome â€“ It\\'s really amazing here. The staff is nice, and make you feel at home. There is a lot of diversity and new experiences that can be made at this UniveristyThe facilities at UTA are really good. They\\'re some buildings that are getting older, but they have quite a bit of modern attributes. They are constantly trying to make the campus more modern and they are succeeding. The gym is amazing and there will be a new sports facility in the Spring of 2012.There is tons of transportation around campus and it is fast and convenient. It is also completely free to UTA students.First Year Freshman Who Are Biology Majors â€“ As a first year freshman I am not completely sure how the work load is. I have not got into my intended degree as I have been finishing up my basic requirement. If the biology work load is anything like the workload of my classes it will be just enough but not enough to bog you down.Arlington Hall is the best to be! Makes it easy to have new friends.Start Early â€“ Always start the financial aid process early, double check everything and ask the Aid office for help.Diverse Campus â€“ UTA is a very diverse school, the administration seem to make that a priority. Walking down the hall to class it is not unusual to hear several groups of people speaking different languages. I have not noticed problems with acceptance or problems because of economic background.UTA has good facilities such as the new MAC athletic center(Maverick Activity Center), a centrally located main library, with branches in other areas of the campus, and a student center with food options and meeting spaces. But some of these things are far from where students general have classes, which can make doing somethings between classes hard.Whatever you want is within a 5 minute driving radius.Pretty Good. There is a lot of variety on campus. Within the normal cafeteria there is also a large variety. Basically whatever you want you can probably have it.Not That Bad â€“ If you need something it\\'s probably available. Besides having to pay for printing UTA offers everything you would need to succeed for free.I Love It â€“ I love UTA. I love Bed Races. I love the people here, everyone is so nice and friendly.Too Far Sometimes â€“ They are within walking distance,but they are pretty far to go in between classes. College Park will help with new places to eat at.rnIt does give a variety to walk to a different place.We have campus transportation, but Arlington, Texas does not have a city bus system, so you have to call a buddy if you want to go anywhere other than school.No Football but Great Facilities and Basketball â€“ Even though there is not a football team in the university, (we have the Dallas Cowboys) the basketball and volleyball teams are great and fun to watch.  UTA just got a new stadium and is building another one!  Can not wait :)Bums and Untouchables â€“ UTA has a great, beautiful school and atmosphere during the school day.  But it seems about twice a month a mugging occurs.  Nothing violent, just these untouchables ask to borrow your phone, which you do because you are nice, and the person walks off, back to their car.  And when you ask for your phone back, they pull out a gun and say, \"Its mine now,\" and you are thankful you did not get hurt.  If you live on-campus you have to be careful when walking around because the Life Shelter (homeless shelter) is close by. But it is a great school with a great engineering program.Do You Like Long Walks? Parking is spread out to the outter reaches of campus. It is cheaper than other schools and is still below $120 for the whole school year. There was a spike in population from 28,000 students to 33,000 students with a decrease in parking spaces due to new construction. The reason why it still rates at a B- is because the campus is trying and has various shuttles that circulate throughout the outter parking lots to the inner parts of the campus with return trips as well.This is not a party school. Students come here to get an education that can transform their lives. If you want to party hardy, then go somewhere else. It is just worth it in this economy to sacrafice your grades for a cheap beer buzz.No Football â€“ The university became a part of a new conference in 2011. Basketball teams; yes, all of them, are good, but no FOOTBALL team exists on this campus. This is a huge element missing from UTA. The good part is, academics are high and most people are focused on attaining a degree. If you struggle with grades, then you will always be able to find a classmate who will lend a helping hand.Off Campus - Pros and Cons â€“ Pros of off hosing campus is privacy, no need to share, and your preference of cleanliness. Cons would be they can be very expensive and safety could be an issue. Living on campus provides you with security and on campus police throughout the day but not at apartments. Also commuters have a horrible time finding parking spots every morning. So being able to live on campus as far as parking is a advantage.Came Home â€“ The best part of transferring to UTA, was coming back close to home. I love being close to my family more than I realized.Jason\\'s Deli â€“ Always the best place to grab lunch between classes!A Good School â€“ University of Texas at Arlington is a good school. I only have experience with the science and biology departments but most of the teachers know their stuff. The tutoring and other (free!) help outside of class is great.The campus has a no tobacco policy but many students and faculty continue to smoke and there are no conciseness.Living on â€“ The on campus housing ranges extremely. There are some that are really nice, but others are questionable in there cleanliness. I also dislike the rule that if you live in the nicer halls you have to buy a meal plan. I do not believe that should a requirement.I don\\'t live on campus but I do know that Fuzzy\\'s Tacos is a popular place for UTA students. It also know that the Arlington Highlands is not far from campus, and there are several places to eat that are really good. It has a diverse selection of restaurants and other places to hang out.Quiet and Individualized â€“ Arlington is between two big downtown cities which are Dallas and Fort Worth. and we have the biggest football stadium in U.S. Cowboy stadium. University of Texas at Arlington is really close from the local places.Night Life â€“ There are a LOT of great places to go to have a great time in the Dallas/Fort Worth area; however, the only downside is the commute if you live close to the school or on campus. Your best bet is to get a cab.On campus living is very convenient for the most part; however, one has to deal with all the freshman jokers pulling fire alarms during the night.  Other than that, it is well worth it.The computers on campus are easily accessible.  There are plenty of computers on campus in the library as well as the study lounge with more than enough software for any assignment given in a particular class.  The Engineering Department Lab has loads of engineering software as well as mathematical software such as Mathematica and Matlab.  I have never had a problem with any of the computers on campus or with accessing one.In Between With Food â€“ Arlington is located in the middle of Dallas and Forth Worth. Their is a mall ten minutes away from the university and many restaurants to eat.Process Was Bumpy â€“ I got a good amount of financial aid, but the process was very annoying and time consuming. I would constantly get letters in the mail telling me to add more things to my application, and some didn\\'t even make sense. I wish it was as easy as they say.It barely snows here, but when it does, it is taken seriously. We once had no classes for a full week, leaving everyone worried and anxious about being able to still learn all the material for tests.Parking is only busy in the morning, but by afternoon, most students have left, leaving the best parking open.Safe Campus â€“ I feel always secure on campus. I can walk at midnight and I feel confortable to do it.It\\'s  a safe areathe academics is really good here.The engineering program is really great. The only reason that the university ranks so low is because of the graduation date. This is not a party university by any means. If you are serious about academics then you will do good here. Many people don\\'t graduate not because that school is not good but because they are not serious about the study and can\\'t take up the load.All my classes are in the social work building.  There\\'s not that many social work majors, but all the engineering students park in that lot as well (I don\\'t think they have parking) and it\\'s awful.  The first day of class I circled the lot for over an hour.  Missed that class.  Everyday I have to make sure to have 30 minutes of time carved out for parking.  One of my classes is from 6-850 pm and parking is non-existent, except in the faculty section.  Wide open spaces.  BUT can\\'t park there until 7p.m.  Can\\'t park at another lot because we get out of class at 9pm and we\\'re not at the best part of campus (closest lot is a 5 minute walk).  I\\'ve seen campus security in the lot when I get out of class ONCE this semester.  Everything is unlit and abandoned.  I grew up in a huge city, lived downtown, I\\'m not afraid of my own shadow.  But screw walking to my car at 9 p.m. at that school.   My other classes are at 2.  If I find parking within 15 minutes I consider myself very lucky.  All the lots are packed at this time, so while I don\\'t have to worry about walking alone for 5 minutes in a tree filled (more places for people to hide imo), unlit street at 9p.m.... it wouldn\\'t matter.  I\\'d just be circling another lot.  Get more parking, seriously.  It\\'s beyond ridiculous.  I\\'ve never been to a school with this much of a parking problem.  Thanks for the parking garages all the way across campus, but the social work parking lot NEEDS to be expanded, big time.It is very easy to get internships at UTA. My school is very highly valued and several employers come to try and recruit here.There have been a couple of small crimes committed on campus, however with all the available blue posts that can be used to call UTAPD, I still feel relatively safe.Greek life makes a significant impact by always grilling food for students walking to class and throwing great parties, but besides that I know little about them.As a member of a spirit group I have plenty of experience at games at our school and it is always a blast motivating everyone to cheer on our school teams.I may not have any other college to compare it to, but I can confidently say that I love UTA and everything about it. My favorite experiences so far have been the time I\\'ve spent as a member of a spirit group called the Wranglers.The community had a wonderful vibe that made me want to stay there.The overall experience I have had is really great. The people are so culturally diverse. The staff is very helpful. There are many ways to get involved!Its very challenging but fun at the same timedon\\'t know squat about ithandicapped basket ball and cross country athletes are always winning something.I\\'ve made great friends/connections here.It is okay to be here. It is Texas state university so the tuition fee is affordable if you attend with instate tuition fee. And this university has awesome gym as good as class of ultra sport of 24-hour fitness in Irvine in California. They have good engineering and nursing major system.there were a couple burglar incidentsIt has a great science program.Not everyone stays on campus so the campus was kind of dead at times.Almost anyone can join if you can pay.Has everything and even the athletes use it from time to time .great opportunity for nursing majorsReally chill school , lot of commutersMostly Standard college classes. Some excelIt\\'s one of the most diverse campuses in Texas. Excellent nursing program with a 85% NCLEX passing rate. Great basketball teams. In the entertainment city. Lots of cultural events. A decent amount of students in class. We are making progress towards increasing the retention rate. It\\'s inexpensive. Close to DFW.It\\'s in the entertainment city, however the downtown atmosphere seems unsafe and old. I wish they can improve downtown Arlington. Overall, the college academics are great, however the commuting atmosphere makes the school seem so plain. I want them to build more dorms, I was put on the waiting list for dorms. The diversity is great, and the cultural events are entertaining. Everyone seems friendly and the school has an excellent reputation for it\\'s basketball and nursing program. They are also making a new building called the college park center.Yes UTA is like most universitys, were they only the best and try to work with you so you can get there. Don\\'t get me wrong either they or verry strict in our GPA. Keeping your greads up and actually been in class ore the things their inforcing.To be honest i have not lived in a dorm or anything close to the college i live about 30-45min away from it. But I can say that will i been in school u can tell is a better to stay in campus and be more close to the school its way easier. The social atmosphere is great at UTA you can meet so many different type of people from all around the country. In the future Im hopping to get a dorm in school their very nice and clean so why not. I will like to expirance the life in the dorms, from the stories they told me its pretty good.Architecture Is Awesome. I have no regrets so far being in the architecture program. Although i had to drop a few times I have retaken those classes and everything has worked out for the better. I am concerned about finding a job once I graduate. There are not too many positive things I hear about finding work out in the field.Not only do you see people of different ethnicity at UTA but individuals with very interesting backgrounds. I know a guy who looks asian but he is from Ecuador and speaks fluent spanish. I have friends who come from other parts of the world: Russia, Dubai, Sri Lanka, Nipoli, Japan...and so much more! I love being surrounded by all kinds of different people.Architecture...The Most Difficult Yet Greatest Experience in My Life â€“ Architecture at UTA is a very rigorous program filled with all-nighters, hard work, and sometimes even impossible deadlines. I have had to drop classes a few times because of the work load and also working part time. Although it has been a difficult journey, i have learned so much about architecture through different professors, students, design build program, and trips to other places. Architecture for me has been an awesome experience so far and I enjoy every moment.The process was easy. I applied for a federal loan during the application period. I wish they would have given opportunities for scholarships and grants, as well.Very hard to find parking spots beyond the early morning, should you come in during the rush hour you can expect to spend 10-15 minutes looking for a place or alternatively parking very far away.Decent, but Somewhat Restricted â€“ While there\\'s a good variety of options, the problem is that the food court does not work very well on those days when you are doing long hours and happen to have a class just before the food court closes.Get Caught, and You\\'re Out â€“ School policies for underage drinking and drug use include loss of housing and loss of education at UTA.Not Much Clubs Nearby â€“ There\\'s a few in Arlington about 5-10 minutes away, but if you want to go to a decent one, you\\'ll have to go to Dallas which is about 30 minutes away.Arlington Hall Dorms â€“ This is my second year here at UTA\\'s Arlington Hall. The dorms provide good amenities such as study rooms on each floor, a fully-equipped kitchen for cooking, laundry rooms on each floor, lounge rooms with t.v. and sitting area on each floor, a great room with t.v., pool and ping pong tables, and sitting areas, basketball court on one side and sand volleyball on the other side, housekeeping services, wi-fi services, and etc. Social atmosphere could be better. The cost is affordable (about 540 a month with no extra bills, and the location is very convenient. The hall is located close to the University Center, bookstore, and many of the buildings for classes. Application for housing is simple, but there\\'s a long waiting list for the dorms. If you\\'re not a freshman/returning resident, there\\'s a likely chance that you will not be able to get a room.I commute, trying to find a parking spot in the morning until 2pm is difficult and time consuming.Lacks School Spirit â€“ What I would call a degree factory. A major street runs through the center of campus and not much school spirit. Crime is also a problem, I must have received 5 police bulletins in the first month of the semester, including someone being robbed at gunpoint. I have already planned my transfer.Off Campus Varies â€“ The Apartments near campus can be inexpensive, but run-down and high crime.  In order to have a great time, you have to move driving distance to be safe, but still great town, great prices, lots of fun.University Hall Dining â€“ This dining experience lets you see your fellow students and eat a great meal, whether you want american dining or something different, UT Arlington has it. Plus it has very close fast food choices in downtown Arlington, Texas.Student involvement here are very high-spirited. The teams are very diverse. The facilities, especially with the newly-renovated gymnasium is state-of-the-arts. I just recently got back into going to the gymn after 12 years of inactivity and help me with my 16 years of drug addiction. Thanks so much UTA!!!!!The UTA\\'s computer labs are up-to-date with printing, network reliability and speed, wireless access and all related matters in dealing with computer technology are awesome. The staffers are very courteous, helpful and competent.UTA is located within walking distance to downtown Arlington. This area has been under constant renovations. The museum (AMA) and all other public venues are great to visit. Go Mavericks!!!!On-Line Course â€“ Although I am an on-line learner, the University of Texas keeps me aware of their sports and tries to get everyone to support the teams.I am not sure how the local weather affects the school, I do know that newsletters are sent whenever school is closed for weather.On-Line Education â€“ I currently attend campus via the on-line program however, we do get weekly newsletters that address the no tolerance position.there are branches of dining chains within walking distance of the campus, with prices comparable to those in other branches , but I have not seen any student discount.Never Heard of It! There is a lack of communication concerning this point at UTA. I would like to participate in an internship program later on. I think that you can learn a lot and grow by being an intern.Busy Busy Busy â€“ There is always a party somewhere! Arlington highlands is also a party on its own! Transport sucks though!Apartments Rule! Even though apartments may be a bit more expensive, you have much more freedom to do what you want both in and around the apartment. Amenities are much better as well.It Is Going Awesome So Far! UTA is the place for me. I\\'m not really into the nightlife. But I do enough hanging out with my friends and there are plenty of spots on campus to do that.Just Enough â€“ At the beginning of the year it is alway over crowded and extremely hard to find a parking space. But several lots are have been made and a new garage.Go to Dallas â€“ The nightlife at UTA is pretty dead. Other than on Greek Row or apartment all the partying is going on in Dallas.Get Learning Environment and Professors! I\\'ve had some great professors at UTA that are willing to work with you and don\\'t just read off a powerpoint. In the smaller class of about 20-30 student there are many class discussions and group activities. The university offers many ways for some extra help. Such as tutoring, writing center and SI sessions. rnEven though I find the academics great at UTA, it isn\\'t perfect and some areas need work.Small Town Atmosphere. Other than on-campus recreational facilities, cowboys stadium and a few other places most of the attractions are in the neighboring city, Dallas. Especially, when it comes to night life.A Crowded Sea â€“ The College of Nursing at UT Arlington has grown exponentially over the past years. The number of students who are accepted pales in contrast to the number of students who apply. It is somewhat stressful with the deadlines and waiting period to find out whether or not you were accepted. However, they do clearly outline what will make you competetive when you apply so you have a good idea of what you need in order to to gain admission.Extensive Options in Education â€“ UT Arlington has a broad spectrum of majors and fields of study for prospective students. Whether pursuing an undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate degree, the colleges within UT Arlington are more than capable of meeting any educational needs or desires.In and Around Arlington â€“ Arlington is nestled right between Dallas and Fort Worth, making a trip to either both quick and convenient. Arlington draws visitors from both of these nearby cities, with a wide variety of entertainment options. From theme parks to sports franchises, nightlife to dining, Arlington has so much to offer.Great School! I love this school and I am very satisfied and I would definitely choose it if I had to all over again.There are plenty of different ethnicities and interests among the students at UTA. I think any student would fit in with at least one group.I Do Not Live on Campus.. but I know  a lot of people who do and they are very happy and well-rounded.Nursing Program â€“ This program is amazing at UTA! We have our own smart hospital with state of the art mannoquins and everything is extremely realistic.Great Nursing Program â€“ ALl of my teachers so far have been amazing! The classes are all very beneficial and I have really connected with a lot of my professors. They have all been very fair.Great University â€“ UTA is anawesome school. The campus is pretty and very comfortable. The teachers are great and they honestly care about you! I love it here;I am a Biology major and that\\'s a hard major to persue but UTA pushes to go do your best at everything and reach your goal. There is a local hospital couple blocks from the school where pre-med students can volunteer.A Great Place to Be! University of Texas at Arlington is one of the best schools around. The school is split in two by a main highway and is surrounded by a lot of restaurants. Six flags is literally 7 minutes from UTA.School Location â€“ I am not surprise there so much crime in this university, almost everyday there are warnings of possible suspects walking around campus. The school is located in the worse part of the city of Arlington. Just to get to the school is a huge unwanted adventure, having to go through so many traffic lights and never ending traffic. The school is also located beside a high school, numerous shopping centers, the mall,the cowboys stadium etc... so you could imagine the odyssey just to get there. The neighborhood is poor and there are many people that mingle into the campus just to steal and cause aggression.The atmosphere at nice and I feel like I am at home. I don\\'t even feel homesick as much.I Don\\'t Want to Graduate â€“ I love UTA! I am so happy that I choose to attend UTA and it be part of my university experience. The classes are not easy, you have to study to pass and study even more to excel! Here at UTA students come from all parts of the world to sit in one class room and learn, but also teach us how to be well balanced individuals.Say No to Drugs but I\\'ll Take a Drink Instead! UTA is pretty much a Anti-drug campus. But, Texans never say no to a free drink!Killing Brain Cells â€“ Nightlife at UTA consists of drinking, drinking, and, drinking! When students say lets party, in other words they are saying \"I want to get wasted!\" Arlington highlands has a few bars that the older students like to go but with the cost of tution they tend to just stay on campus.Pretty Good â€“ Most of the place on campus are good. There is a lot of variety in things you could eat.Helping Hand â€“ The professors at UTA are pretty helpful. All of the professors I have had have been more than willing to help me out when ever I needed extra help. As far as the classes go, they move at a pretty decent pace. They are not so fast that you will be lost if you miss a class or two but you definately need to study to keep upI think the one cool thing about UTA is that the students that attend college here are so friendly. You see some of the same faces and you get pretty comfortable at this campus pretty fast.The location where UTA is at is great, you have places like Chipotle, Chili\\'s, Razoos and lost of other fast food places to go, therefore it\\'s very convenient. The cost isn\\'t that bad if you wanna go for some cheap fast food, and you at least get a 10 percent student discount if you are around that area as long as you show them your UTA id card.Physician Assistant â€“ I have recently changed my my major in order to become a physician assistant. There is a lot of responsibility when it comes to this specific major, my gpa has to be at least a 3.7, I am currently the Vice president of the Circle K club (community service) and I will be working. This is no easy task, but I am willing to commit to one day reach an fulfill my dreams.Like any University, the weather can always be a factor in terms of your experience on campus. You have to travel to classes, thus having to walk outside in the rain, heat, snow, etc. Texas is know for its crazy and unpredictable weather conditions each season. At least there are several trees that provide lots of shade for students, and the buildings are all air conditioned, safe and healthy for us as students.School Is Now Tobacco Free â€“ I suppose this is mainly for the health concern, recently UTA has announced it will be tobacco free campus as a whole. To tobacco users, or smokers, I suppose they may feel a bit indifferent about the new policy but truthfully it was much debated over time. UTA works with the Student Government frequently to take in the opinions and voices of its students and faculty to see what they can improve on, what can be changed. I find that an important asset to the university because it cares about making the campus more enjoyable and efficient for all its members.Overall UTA does a great job. I enjoy going to school, I enjoy being involved with the Maverick Community, I think it\\'s a great institution and choice for anyone going to college. They work hard to meet the students need, and reach satisfaction from many of us.UT-Arlington Safety â€“ safety and security  is important to the staff and students. All ways getting updates in emails about a crime on campus and tips for things not getting stolenNot Much â€“ I do not know much because, I am only taken my bacis, the fall semester will be the start of my major classes required for my programIt\\'s a Diverse Campus â€“ Their are a lot of different culture on this campus. And we all get along, very well.Never Have Used the Computer Labs â€“ I have never used the computer labs at the University of Texas at Arlington. There\\'s never been a need for me to do so.They Want You to Succeed â€“ The professors I have had at the University of Texas at Arlington have been great. They are professional, kind, very attentive towards the students objectives, and helpful in answering any questions a student may have regarding school work or any other topic. I have heard several professors mention during orientation their desire to help each and every student succeed with their studies.I have been looking for a fraternity for a while now. There are so many choices! Anyone can find their fit here. They throw some good parties, and pretty much anyone can go. A lot of charitable work is done by Greeks, so they have a good impact on the community. They have some nice homes down Greek Row.Hot Girls Galore â€“ Most of the girls dress to impress every day. There won\\'t be a day where you don\\'t see an attractive girl walking by. Guys dress in the typical style, shorts, tshirt, perhaps the occasional hipster. Everyone is pretty much from DFW, so city people. We do have a significant number of country guys and girls though, it is Texas after all.The geology department is small, but that is what makes it great. There are many research projects going on, and undergraduates are welcome to help. It really gives students opportunities to immerse themselves in the field due to it\\'s small size. This would be a rarity in bigger campuses due to the large number of students. The professors get to know you on a personal level and truly care about your education. It is more than I had ever hoped for.Professors and Classes â€“ All the teachers are great and the classes really help you with your major.Relatively Satisfied. I did my classes online.  We communicated with academic coach more than the teachers.  The classes were 5 weeks long and a lot of materials were covered during that time period.  It was hectic but I am glad I was done with my BSN in 13 months.Parking is atrocious between the main class hours (Mon.-Fri. between 8a-7p). After that, everyone starts clearing out. Its funny though b/c over the weekends, the parking lots are like a ghost town b/c so many people go home.Pretty Good Options â€“ there are quite a few options for any type of apartment you prefer but they can be pricey. Johnson Creek Crossing && the newly built Midtown apartments are both fully furnished with most bills paid && the amenities are pretty legit. If you want to go w/ a cheaper option, there are campus apartments such as Timber Brook && Arbor Oaks but you have to furnish them yourself && I\\'m not too sure on how many bills you have to pay yourself. Maverick Place and Centennial Court are within walking distance but you have to cross super busy Cooper St. to get to class && that\\'s no fun. Also, STAY AWAY FROM CENTENNIAL. I\\'ve heard nothing but bad things about the place (ghetto, bad interior, etc.). So, if you have to stay across Cooper St, go with Maverick Place. There are also many options that are a farther distance but I don\\'t know too much about those except don\\'t live there if you don\\'t have a car.For the most part, the academics at UTA are pretty great. If you\\'re in the Nursing program, you\\'re definitely getting a top of the line education b/c our program is one of the best in the nation. You have your fair share of classes that are difficult && you have your blow-off classes. Watch out for the classes with foreign professors though...those are always a killer.Social Atmosphere â€“ Arlington is a great city to live in whether living in a dorm, apartment, or with family.Imaginary Bus Stops â€“ The transportation at UTA has a good reputation, but the areas to be picked up at are not very practical. The buses can be seen several times throughout the day but I\\'ve never actually seen people get on or off of them. As far as I know, the places to get on them are around the stadium and I have never once had to park anywhere near there.The MAC â€“ The Maverick Activity Center at UTA is amazing. With two olympic sized pools three fabulous indoor tracks, this facility offers a great environment for students to stay healthy and active.A Challege â€“ The academics offered at the University of Texas at Arlington are worthy of notice. Each class promises challenge and hard work. Most teachers are great and have a real passion for their topic of study. The workload can be a bit much at times, but advisors do their best to make sure each student only takes on as much as he or she can handle. Though some areas could use improvements (such as the registration process and TAs) the University of Texas at Arlington truly offers curriculum that prepares students for the competitive careers ahead of them.The college is a public school, therefore there are not many rules.it has a very good level of academic. the standars are high with great staff.The BEST Fitness Center I Know â€“ The Maverick Activities Center (or the MAC, as we call it) is my favorite place on the UT Arlington campus. With state-of-the-art fitness equipment, on-site trainers, an indoor track, swimming pool, rock climbing wall, AND soccer field, I have everything I need to ensure that I keep optimum health-- and have fun doing it.My Academic Experiences â€“ I would recommend the University of Texas at Arlington to anyone who would listen. Registration is a simple, generated online process. The campus is smaller than others, but the layout is beautiful. All of the buildings have up-to-date facilities, and everything is accesible. Every professor that I have come in contact with is exemplary in the field(s) he/she teach(es). I enjoy attending class, and enjoy listening to the lectures-- no, not lectures. More like detailed discussions that captivate me, and hold my attention. Of course, nothing is perfect, but UTA sure does come close.Wish I Knew â€“ I commute to campus, and work a part-time job to cover what my financial aid does not. Unfortunately, I haven\\'t had the opportunity to be very involved on-campus. However, I have several friends that have joined Greek life and even work on-campus, and I\\'m totally jealous! There\\'s always something going on, be it a basketball game, free movie night, or concert. I\\'m working on saving up to move closer to school so I can really check out campus life at UTA.Wet and Windy! During the stormy seasons, the campus will sometimes flood, which is a real pain if you\\'re not wearing the right shoes! The winds can also be very strong between buildings. But the weather is generally nice in that area, and you can often find students outside chatting with friends or playing frisbee.Great People, Tons of Help! I am still a freshman, but my experience at UTA so far has been very interesting. My first semester, I joined a Biology Freshman Interest Group (FIG), and it was great! It\\'s a class full of other freshman who are taking essentially the same classes as you - so forming study groups was super easy! I had to work a lot and so I was unable to attend many of them, but overall the program was very helpful. My science professors have been great. They expect a lot from you, and the workload is heavy, but it will only help in the long run. We have tutors and clinics available when we need help, which is a huge plus as well. In the coming year I hope to move closer to campus so I can utilize more of these great amenities!Features Available â€“ Research Opportunity is available for students. There are lot of scholarship and extra-curricular activities available.Lounge Hall â€“ Food is great. have a exclusive dining room as well as the regular fast food for students who wish it.. Its an all inclusive area that caters to the needs of all.. Meals are delivered accordingly as well.Health and Safety â€“ UTA safelty approach in matters such as storm management and general student safety is top of the line that ensures student and faculty safety first before all. Also the provision of having an health center on campus and health facilities improves the general health of the students. never felt unsafe while on campus, incidents have occured but the police is always on hand to walk one to the car.Finance Major â€“ Finance is a good major of study at UTA. Lots of classes and help with those classes that present a challenge to most students. For me I had an experience where a class was really hard to comprehend the dynamics of the case study but with the help of the professor and other students we were able to pass the class whoich shows UTA commitment to positive learning.Find people with many diversities yet feel comfortable.If you do fafsa on time, the school offers pretty good scholarships, especially with a high GPA. The office is helpful and finds ways to help.There are parties at least once a week. The school is also good about throwing events for students. Its close to clubs, bars, bowling, skating, parks mall, restaurants and all sorts of things to have fun.There are many computer labs around campus and even inside of the dorms. There are also places to print and students can rent laptops at the library. The internet speed is great and the computers are up to date with needed software already provided.Alot of Sports but No Football â€“ There is no football team, but that\\'s in the future I hear. There are alot of other sports and sports activities daily. There is also church in the Mav Center on Sunday mornings.Apartment on Campus â€“ The new dorms are very nice, but small. The apartments on campus have 4 per apartment, but everyone has their own room and share a bathroom with one other person.Much to Do â€“ Arlington is a town in the middle of the DFW Metroplex, with Six Flags over Texas, Water Park, Dallas Cowboy and Ranger Stadium. There are shopping malls and 2 Walmarts close by. Many restaurants are near.it is a nice place to learn and meet new and excellent peopleparking is hard fine when u want a close parking to the building but it a lot of space in the back but its far to walkthey are nice guys at uta and very smart ones too!Not to Much Drugs. At UTA I have not seen any \"druggies\". Smoking is a huge problem at UTA, their everywhere! Hopefully UTA will be a smoke free campus soon.Way to Much Indian Students â€“ At UTA their are many different types of people. Although our student body consists of mostly people from India.I\\'m part of the college of science and I love everything about it. I love learning about the brain and development and the true importance of psychology and science as a whole.The Job Opportunities â€“ There are multiple job opportunities at UTA that pay pretty well, and they\\'re flexible around your class times.The Parks at Arlington â€“ The Parks at Arlington is a nearby mall within a mile to the university that provides students with close-proximity stores and a giant food court with acceptable prices.Maverick Activity Center â€“ The Maverick Activity Center is a state-of-the-art and brand new building that lets students work out and play basketball or soccer for free on campus. A lot of students call it the MACPainful Fiancial Aid Process â€“ Receiving financial aid is a very long and annoying process. It takes a lot of work to get people to follow through with you and your awards.Drinking and Drugs â€“ The drug scene at UT Arlington is not that big, drinking is more popular. This occurs mostly at parties.On Campus Living â€“ The dorms in the University of Texas at Arlington are a great way of meeting new friends and getting to experience life as a student.Grade Replacement Policy â€“ Overall I thinked they worked with you academically, except for the grade replacement policy change that did not make amends for students who started before the transition in 2006. Totally screwed me my senior year!Sports Are Not Big â€“ We don\\'t even have a football team!. We seriously lacked in this area. The basketball team did have a few good seasons while I was there.It was great from a convenience standpoint initially, but you get tired of it and alot of the choices are pricey. There are better options and discounts available off campus.There are no buses in Arlington, but there is an on-campus shuttle that will take you anywhere you need to go, with stops at key locations on campus near classes, the gym, and the cafe.Not Noticeable â€“ I barely even notice the Greeks, they have their own housing on the west side of the campus, a little out of the way. If you join, its seems pretty fun, but if you don\\'t, you\\'ll barely notice them at all.Could Be Better â€“ The immediate area surrounding the college is not very good, it\\'s run down and offers limited or no attractions. The area doesn\\'t give off a very safe vibe either, but the campus police do their job well enough to keep you safe if you stay on campus. However, it is close to Dallas and Fort Worth, where you could find anything you\\'re looking for: entertainment, recreation, etc.Parking kind of sucks right now, but we are getting 2 new parking garages pretty soon. Parking permits are worth it. You can easily rack up on parking fines and if you don\\'t pay you could possibly get towed. Get a permit...Getting Better â€“ Arlington overall isn\\'t too safe of a place after dark. But the campus does provide special security measures to help prevent crime. The police do try to keep our campus safe. It is getting better. This past semester there has been less crime reports. There will be crime on any college campus.Love at Second Sight â€“ My very first time stepping on the campus (Summer during freshman orientation) I was like \"why am I here?\" After being here 2 years I LOVE this place and wouldn\\'t leave it! It is so easy to make friends and the campus is great! If you pick the right crowd to hang with your time at UTA will be the BEST time of your life!Apartment Party â€“ There is always a weekend party at certain apartment complexes. Involves a lot of drinking.\"Frat Daddy\\'s&quot â€“ You will know a \"Frat Daddy\" when you see one...they all pretty much hangout on the 4th floor of the library.I don\\'t know much about UTA housing as I live at home, but it is obviously extremely expensive and quite a hassle. I do not recommend it.The professors at UTA are all likable and knowledgeable. There is a wide variety of subjects to study and options to pursue.There is usually an abundance of computers and there is no limit on time. It is possible to do work and/or projects on them, however, it is personal preference to instead own a private laptop.Foreign Students â€“ There are a lot of Foreign students at UTA. It makes the university unique because they accept a lot of students from other countries, which adds the flavor of the school.Weather is usually not a big problem. It is very hot around summer time, and it gets cold, but it is typical for Texas.Boring library, with typical floors of books and computers. There are many cubicles to use to study, however they are for the most part very small.the security is reinforced ,we may have other issues going on campus such as alcohol on campus  but as far as i know my entourage don\\'t use any drugs  and if we don\\'t bring any alcohol on campus .Guys & Girls â€“ we have a variety of people coming from around the world especially from Nepal & India. most of us are trying to get along each others. everybody dress pretty dissent.Extremely Simple â€“ Applied for the school, received scholarship, have to do very little work to receive scholarship money every semesterNothing Special â€“ Lack of school spirit means very little athletic support on campus, baseball and wheel chair basketball are really the only sports worth going to games for, however all games are free for studentsVery Diverse Students & Professors â€“ Very diverse student body, professors from quite a few different backgrounds, accounting classes are the most difficult, workload is fairly reasonable, too many professors with poor English skills, business building is nothing specialI love the Arlington/dfw atmosphere! With the theme parks and plenty of yummy food places and shopping areas its pretty hard to beat.They have great working computers as well as the internet. The library environment is very cozy. You can always find a spot. Most of the students do have their own laptops but for those who dont, they dont have to spend their money to buy one, the labs have enough computers to serve the needs to many.My School â€“ So far my experience here has been okay. Most people who go here are commuters so it is difficult to meet new people.The best thing about UTA is the price it.is a lot cheaper than most schools.Heavy traffic in the mornings when coming from Ft.Worth on 30, it.usually takes me 30-45min to get to school from Haltom City. There is no public transportation that will take you too school, only on-campus buses.,I haven\\'t lived in off-campus apartments yet because of pricing. Parking is a pain to find anytime of the day. Campus police are always present, very safe environment.I can\\'t event tell there is a Greek life if there is one.This school has great diversity, much more than the undergraduate school I attended.  This really helps with meeting and understanding a variety of people from different cultures and backgrounds.School Policies â€“ This school policies are not strict. You dont have a time you have to go to bed. There is no specific rules on bringing guest or family members. Your basically an adult and responsible for balancing your academic and social lives.Being underage and wanting to go to clubs can seem frustrating. But there is always a party where students rent somewhere. It is always fun. You might have to drive a little far from campus but not too far. But its always worth it.Campus Crime â€“ The campus security is great. The only main crime here is sometimes you hear loud music other then that you are safe. The school also has buttons you can press all around campus so that in the unfortunate event that you are atacked, you can press it and campus police will be there in no time.due to the bad weather conditions that hit arlington this winter, classes were cancelled for a weekthere are many places within the boundaries of the school, where students can go to buy different foodsMy school is located on the busiest street in the city of arlington. because of this, many people have opened different restuarant to attract customers who use the street. there are different cuisine from different parts of the world and because the city of arlington is known as a college town, most of these restuarants have been built within a five to ten miles radios around the school.Texas Is Horrible in General â€“ The campus has alot of fun activites but sometimes Texas\\'s crazy weather gets in the way.There Is No Football!!! So there is no regular homecoming and homecoming is not very seriousGuys Are  Cute â€“ Most of them are city guys and are cute but their shyness is a problem/Greeks Are Everywhere â€“ All of the fraternities/sororites recruit outside the University Center with posters, grilling, handing out free stuff. They\\'re everywhere you look. You can\\'t go a day without seeing a fraternity trying to rushNearby Food Places â€“ At UT Arlington, there is a Wendy\\'s, McDonalds, Two Subways, Taco Bell, Golden Chick, and Donut Palace all nearby the campus. There are more but I cannot recall all of them. Some offer student discounts, but more often than not I forget to ask about it. You won\\'t go hungry, there\\'s fast food within walking distance of UTA, and lots of varietyStudent Academic Evaluation â€“ Some professors actually care about their students, and some do not. Here at UT Arlington, I have had my share of poor professors, and excellent professors. As for the curriculum, if you can follow the professor, and have adequate background knowledge, you won\\'t struggle with the material nor workload.Drug Scene â€“ I don\\'t know a lot about any drug problems at UTA, but EVERYONE smokes! There are cigarette butts all over campus. And of course there is underage drinking going on.I don\\'t really participate in this kind of stuff, but from what I have heard, the bars around here are pretty sleazy, and there are no clubs in Arlington. The only thing I do know is good is hookah lounges.Food Places on Campus â€“ We have a lot of places to eat at (Chick-fil-A, Panda Express, Einstein\\'s Bagels, Pizza Hut, Sushic, Subway, Starbucks) but when you have been here a few years, it kinda gets old. I live off campus so I only grab a bite if I\\'m really hungry.Wonderful Learning Experience â€“ UTA is a great school, especially for what I am studying. I have very much enjoyed my experience so far. I have made many friends and the professors are easy to get in touch with.Better Apartments Are Further Away â€“ Most of the off-campus housing near the campus is not so desirable. But if you go a little northeast of the campus, the apartment selction is better. You might pay more, but the apartments are in better condition and are safer.Attractions and Shopping â€“ The University of Texas at Arlington is located near many different attraction. It is only a few miles from the Dallas Cowboys Stadium, Texas Ranger\\'s Stadium and Six Flags Over Texas. Also, the Parks Mall and the Arlington Highlands are great places to shop nearby.Very Safe School â€“ the school is very safe and we have a lot of security always walking arounfInternship Program â€“ My school has an internship program that has allowed me to seek career opportunities and get a little bit of experience. Also, Arlington is a very entertaining city with places like Six Flags, Cowboy\\'s Stadium, Hurricane Harbor, and The Ball Park in Arlington.Campus Living â€“ I do not live on campus. It is rather costly and I only live 30 minutes away from campus, so I figured commuting would be a better option.It takes getting in very early, before 7am to find even a decent spot because the sports fill up fast and sometimes it seems that people won\\'t give up their spots even when their class has let out. Other drivers also aren\\'t that polite when it comes to finding an open spot.Melting Pot â€“ There are a hude diverse groups of people from a variety of diffrent backgrounds and the care in making campus wide desions takes into account those very diverse viewpoints.There are multiple computer labs all over campus that are accessible to all students at a wide range of times. The labs at the Central Library are even open on Sunday till midnight. Its a little tough to find one open during finals and midterms but besides that you are always welcome to go to another lab somewhere else on campus.The food in the cafe is pretty much the same every day. Some of the things change, but if you want anything good, you\\'ll be eating grilled cheese and pizza for every meal. The only \"restaurant\" type stuff we have is chick-fil-a, pizza hut, panda express, and subway. After a while, you get tired of such limited dining options.Depends What Dorm You Live in â€“ Lipscomb Hall is one of the cheapest dorms on the campus. At first, it seemed like although it was an older structure, living there would be fun because of the people. The people at Lipscomb socialize much more than those in other dorms such as KC and Arlington. However, I came to realize that although I was able to meet several new people, the people I met were not the type of people I\\'d like to befriend. Since it\\'s one of the cheapest, I guess that demonstrates why most of the people there are potheads and drinkers. If you like to party and have fun, these are your type of people. There is also a lot of unnecessary drama, and rumors that are just that, rumors. There is a lot of diversity in this school, with many Asians, blacks, and hispanics.If it were difficult to access scholarship and financial aid at UTA, I would not be attending the school. UTA makes this process extremely easy and accessible to anyone in need. I have never had difficulty setting up an appointment with a supervisor or financial aid adviser. My situation forces me to apply for as many scholarships and grants as I possibly can, and UTA provides me with the resources to continue my education.You Win Some, You Lose Some â€“ The campus police have no problem giving parking tickets. I\\'ve known students who have been on the edge of being kicked out of school for their insubordination in this respect. However, it is not too difficult to get away with a small get-together or party in your on-campus apartment. Just don\\'t be too relaxed about it.UTA is not a very well known school but has plenty to offer. If you are interested in sports and outdoor activities, the brand new Maverick Activities Center is the shining pride of the school. Also, if you\\'re interests reside in academics, the university offers some really great study areas with tutors, and an excellent campus writing center. Lastly, who could forget the University Center? Critical to on-campus social affairs, the UC is a prominent hangout on campus. Complete with billiards, a bowling alley, starbucks, and a fully equipped food court, with all your favorite restaurants.For the Minorities and Extremely Talented â€“ The campus focuses very strongly on out of country students so much of their scholarships are geared in helping them which leaves any other grants strictly for the top prominent students. This can make receiving small grants highly unlikely for most students.Bus System for Campus â€“ There is a very convenient bus system that stops all around the large parking lots and some of the campus housing to transport students to and from campus.Basketball, Softball and Volleyball â€“ work hard, great advertisement and fairly competitive teams.My overall experience at UTA was good, but I feel like it could be alot better somewhere elseGreek Life at UTA is pretty much the same as an in any other mid sized campus. Only around 3% of the student population is Greek. I\\'ve had a good time as a greek and it definetly gets me more involved around campus. It teaches you to manage your time betterFood Spots â€“ They have two spots in the same building one is the dining hall where of course its a buffet but it costs around 8 bucks if you don\\'t have any kind of meal plan. The other is a spot where they have subway, panda express, pizza hut, chik-fil-a, and some sushi.. the food is good but really pricy.Security is top notch. There are emergency telephones around every corner and the police force does a very good job of notifying students whenever there is an incident.Texas Is All About the SUN â€“ well weather is hardly bad in here...and bad meaning the temperatures being in the low 30s and there is snow everywhere. Texas is all about the sun like i said. weather is not so awesome because its usually around the 100s in summer for almost 3 months but it doesn\\'t really affect campus experience because people love the sun.Gotta Drive to Get the Good Stuff â€“ School is surrounded by a bunch of ghetto people waiting to have their chance on stealing your purse or mugging you. It\\'s better not to go around at night in Arlington itself because we get university police reports of assaults all the time. Not too far though is Dallas downtown which is a perfect fit for a party animal, got bunch of 18+ clubs and also 21+ clubs for any economic, race, color...around the school are no clubs whatsoever, there are bars but no smoking in bars in arlington...Drive to Dallas, save the headache of a crappy bar and also being robbed, have the best time of your life.UTA is full of diverse ethnic and racial faces. Economically we could find more people of average income,no farraries. Scholarships are available equally to everyone i believe but just like any other schools, americans are more favored when offering jobs and grants...but i guess that\\'s a federal thing and not school. I didn\\'t really see anyone implemeting their political beliefs on me as a teacher or a student but i have seen wierd looks toward slightly different people.Parking Permit costs like around $112 per year and this is a regular parking. If you do not have a parking sticker then you will be getting a ticket of $50. Even though you have a parking sticker it is very difficult to get a parking nearby. As my personal experience, I have parked on the side of other people residential places, and I have to go to school before 8:45 AM to get the parking even though my class starts only at 9:30 AM. And I just live 5 minutes away from school which is ridiculous.The campus isn\\'t really strict, It\\'s basically common sense and you should know the rules once you enter the dorms. The strictness is not too strict, but just know the rules and follow them.I believe that off-campus housing is also a great choice as well. It\\'s living around the campus and also be able to know the neighbors. Sometimes you can even have your own room mates once you pick them.I have experience the housing by the looks of it that the 2-3 bedroom dorms may actually be the best options, but the cost is about $500, but the students may split it. So the housing is very nice and comfortable.Guys Are Cute â€“ Types of guys: rockers, country boys, and then just your everyday normal guy.MAC Is the Place to Be â€“ The facilities are great, especially the MAC, or Maverick Activities Center. The gym is huge, with many basketball courts and exercise classrooms, a lot of workout equipment and great wireless service and more. It\\'s a place to get healthy and meet new people. The University Center is a great place to be, to just hang out with friends and eat in the cafeteria and The Plaza, where there\\'s a Subway, Chick-Fil-A, and sushi place among the food places. The food is kinda overpriced which is a downside, so try not to eat there too much if possible. The campus activities are pretty good, with numerous organizations on campus to join and be active on campus. Greek Life is okay, but could always be better. Some may say that the campus is boring, but you just have the find something to do to be productive and enjoy college life.No 24 Hr Computer Lab Anymore, but Worth It â€“ The computer lab that the school once had isn\\'t there anymore, which is a drag, but students can use any of the computers in the library or in one of the academic buildings on campus. The library is always crowded, so sometimes it\\'s hard to find a computer to do homework or to print, and the printers sometimes have problems which annoy the students. It\\'s kinda beneficial to have your own computer and just print on campus if possible. The network speed for on campus computers are pretty good and reliable.Biology Is Great! The Biology department has different degree plans to follow according to what you want to be, ranging from pre-med to medical technology. The advisors are great and are always willing to lend a helping hand when it comes to advice from internships to what classes to take. The workload isn\\'t easy--come on it\\'s Biology, but it will be all worth it in the end. Job opportunities usually arise from the referral of the Biology advisors or the sponsoring clubs that are on campus such as Pre-Pharmacy Association and Medical Students Prepatory Association.Lots of Place to Shop â€“ There is a Parks mall near UTA, and it\\'s pretty big store and they are on sales many times. There are six flags and hurricane harbor. and cowboy stadiuj near UTASearch the Downtown â€“ For an expensive cost around $12, Bape is pretty good place to go out for dinner. all the sides are unlimited. main course food is amazingly delicious. This restaurant\\'s interior design and outside design is unbelievably well constructed and organized. Anyhow, if you want cheap place, Fuzzy\\'s is good place to go too! Their Nachos and Tacos are so goodEach of Us Unique, All of Us Empowered ! I like going to UT Arlington, because it provides me with a variety of course options and timings. I love my on campus job because it helps me out financially. There are a number of hidden opportunities and one has to dig in to find out about them. I wish the academic advisors were a little more helpful and supportive. Scholarships are rare for international students and I believe they should offer more.We have a very vivid population of students from almost everywhere, Asia to Africa to South America and Middle east. I haven\\'t met a lot of Europeans though. I like meeting people from different countries and this is very easy at UT Arlington.Good but Not That Great. UT Arlington has everything a regular reputed university would have, but services like cafeteria and printers could be improved a little bit. Also the libraries need to stay open for longer times. 24/7 public transportation inside the library is must! Rest is good.The University of Texas at Arlington tries their best to provide transportation for students around campus. There are many stops for shuttles around the campus that transport students from one destination to the next free of charge. Students who cannot afford good parking close to the campus can buy a less expensive parking pass and park somewhere further. However, UTA provides shuttles to pick up the students at shuttle stops and take them to the campus. Overall, I greatly appreciate UTA\\'s afford to help the students.Drug and Alcohol Visibility â€“ I must say that the University of Texas at Arlington\\'s drug and alcohol visibility is excellent. Since attending the university in Fall of 2010, I have not yet witness a single sign of alcohol or drug usages on campus. I am extremely satisfy with the university\\'s enforcement of drug and alcohol prohibition among the students.Parking Stinks â€“ The parking lot is WAY too overcrowded. Walking to class takes me at least twenty minutes from my car to my first class just because the parking lots are always full and far away from campus.Athletic Facilites â€“ The athletic facilities at my school are great. They provide a lot of equipment for athletes and casual gym go-ers to work out on.You\\'re on Your Own â€“ The Financial Aid office is there and it is quite easy to find, however, if you are going to get any help then you have to get ready the specific question to ask. It was quite surprising to me how unhelpful sometimes they can be, you better off just apply online.It\\'s All on the Dice â€“ On the campus, the police and security force is very strict especially when it comes to parking. It is definitely not easy getting through the day without a ticket if one is careless. Drinking, drug use, speeding, and violence are all under surveillance of the police force. However, due to this, it is extremely safe for the majority of the students and allow great peace of mind. As for the classes, the policies go quite easy there and the professors are all very lenient but strict if you get out of bound.Simple Yet Effective â€“ The university have a lot to offer and it have an amazing area for recreation as well as sports. Since the college is greatly diverse, it creates an easy atmosphere for everyone and it is definitely not hard to fit in. There are also cafe and small restaurants located in different buildings throughout the school and allow many friends to catch up with each other. Overall, the feeling and atmosphere of the university is great and enjoyable.The school has many programs and degrees to choose from. The career center is helpful with getting through school and preparing for after graduation.Night Life â€“ We\\'re not much of a party school. You can find a few parties here and there on weekends but they\\'re usually small parties. Most parties take place off campus in the bigger city, Dallas or Fort Worth. Students drink alcohol but not usually at the bars or clubs, they hang out at dorms or apartments.Food at School â€“ We have a cafe place where students on a meal plan can get a variety of meals for each meal of the day. We have some restaurants choices on campus such as, Subway, Chick-fil-A, Pizza-Hut and Panda Express. We have a salad bar and sushi choices. We also have a little student market that has some deli choices and microwaveable foods. We have a good variety to choose from. The price is a little high though.Guys Are Awkward â€“ You\\'ll barely notice anyone talking to you if you are not in the Greek Society.I really like how easy and quickly they responded with the financial aid. UNT took forever to reply back and they did not even give me enough money so my family won\\'t be in debt.I Commute â€“ It would be great if UTA makes some more available parking lots because every semester the student population increases. You don\\'t really need a car to get around campus because of the buses.The computers at UTA work great! I\\'ve never had one crash on me and they also have Macs provided on campus. I appreciate how they have Adobe programs provided on computers that aren\\'t in the classroom because it would suck if I had to wait for classes to be finish to use the computers. I also appreciate that they have good ink in the printers because at home sometimes my printer does not print good quality. I can always rely on UTA\\'s systems to help me get the job done without having to worry about mistakes.Money Money Money! The financial aid process was great! No major setbacks or anything!Onine Is Schooling Is Looking-Up! I was completely over-joyed when I seen that UTA offered the online BSN in nursing. I have been looking for a school that offered this type of program for years. So when I finally came across this on the UTA\\'s website I was so thankful! UTA finally put an end to my search! Thanks UTA!Mostly Standard college classes. Some excelThere are lots of officers to speak too. Very SafeGetting my apartment was easy and painlessIt\\'s fairly standard. Community events and friendsWithout a Football program, it can be shallow.I enjoy the pace. It\\'s a very \"upbeat\" environmentThere have been multiple assaults last semester but they were all in other parts of campus from my classes.UTA has an incredible glassblowing program that I feel extremely blessed to be part of! ! So many talented folks that are eager to help anytime!I take advantage of rate my professor to avoid getting bad ones but sometimes I have no control over it and it affects my grade in that class. The class sizes varies from class to class.There have been a good deal of incidents of crime on campus but I generally feel safe on campus even though I try to avoid being out by myself after it gets dark.Vandergriff is the best. The housing process is simple. Overall the residence halls are good.The athletic facilities are great and I believe the teams are good but school spirit is horrible.I\\'m only going to be a sophomore but its been okay. There\\'s a lot of cool things going on during the start of a new school year.It typically depends on the major.It is a large state school, not small or private.I am sure there is crime, but I am unaware so far.I am not very familiar with Greek life on campus.UTA does not have many competitive school teams.Once admitted everyone was helpful.I have a job on campus and I love working there. The people are so helpful and kind.The weather in Texas is very unpredictable but UTA does a good job of helping their students during these crazy days!I didnt get any scholarships and I dont qualify for work study so i have to take out loans and work while in school.Mc Donalds by the campus gives a student discount and Wing Stop does also.Need Sme Work â€“ need more for students that is not based on sat scores and need some for continuing studentsApply Early for Housing â€“ Because it is a commuter campus, there are not a lot of openings for dorms. There is no differentiation between freshman dorms and upperclassmen dorms, so get your application in early so you can get the dorm you want. There is a wide range of quality of dorms, with the 2 newer dorms ( K.C. Hall and Arlington Hall) being very nice and the rest of the older dorms rather dumpy (Brazos and Trinity). There is relatively no middle ground, except one (Lipscomb) that is older but still acceptable.Music Department â€“ I choose UTA because of the influence of the violin professor, from whom I had been taking lessons throughout high school. The rest of the professors in the music department are all very friendly and know all the students in the program because it is a small community. Despite its compact size, the program is flourishing with talented teachers and students. I have learned a ton over my three semesters and do not mind repeating professors because they are all great teachers.Athletic Centers â€“ The athlectic centers are excellent. The workout facility and the basketball courts are the best. They have alot of activities that you can be involved in and even more for your own personal training regime. The places to just chill out with friends and relax after classes are awesome!! So many choices of things to do from studying to relaxing makes college life better.UTA is very diverse with a pretty even mixture of white,asian,indian, and latino races.Could Be Better â€“ I would like to see a better faculty/staff especially at the financial aid desk. Bus routes take too long, they need more buses for more people.Crimes Happen Sporadically â€“ The security at my school do a good job of keeping crime rates low.The University of Texas at Arlington is well known for its openness to admissions, however, with requirements. The university\\'s library is open 24-7 especially during Mid-terms and finals weeks. UT Arlington is less strict on the freedoms that every student desire. The school has a wide variety of availabilities in accessing computers, lounges, cafes, gyms, and food courts.Crimes on Campus â€“ The University of Texas at Arlington is an extremely large campus. It would be difficult to spot any drug activity amongst students or non-students on campus. However, the university does have a good security force in which there are several security personnel driving in and around campus. I personally have not heard of any drug-related incidents.Apart from the workload and studying for tests, the nightlife at the University of Texas at Arlington is terrific! However, most of these events include some sort of payment to enter. It is better to have parties and hangouts in a student\\'s own dorm room.UTA is located in downtown Arlington and so there are many businesses around. There are plenty of restaurants, some old and some new, but they are convenient to get to. I\\'ve only heard of a few student discounts at some places though. The variety is good, but its mostly fast food. When I want to get something fast I either go to Chipotle or Bethany, an asian restaurant.Thus far, I have received a federal aid from applying FAFSA though it does not cover the extra costs for attending a semester at UT Arlington. Some of the federal aid is loan and it is both subsidized and unsubsidized. I currently struggle trying to earn a scholarship because I have to pay an out-of-state tuition. The books are very expensive! These are extra costs that are considered when I pay for the UTA semester tuition. I am still searching and applying for scholarships and hoping that I will earn some to be able to afford the extra costs of attending UT Arlington!I live at an apartment in a different city, so I have to commute through the freeway 360. As for apartments near UT Arlington, I\\'ve been to some of them, and it is really comforting. Some of the housing are available before a semester begins because there are a lot of students who need housing as close to campus as possible. There\\'s an apartment called Centennial Court, and it has modern-style interior designs and furniture. It has lots of parking space, a gym, and it is close to campus. Another one is called Maverick place or \"UTA student housing.\" It has the same aspects, however, it is a large cubic building with an open-door swimming pool in the center. Every apartment near UTA has a local police car that checks the area. Overall, I would definitely recommend students to come in one of the UTA\\'s off-campus housing.The public computers at UT Arlington Library is very helpful to students with no computers in their nearby apartment or dorm rooms. Computers at the UT Arlington Library have two central areas where students can print out their papers. The downside of having central printers is that during finals or midterms, they may get very crowded. During the day, practically all of the computers are being used, and some students would have to stand around and race each other for a seat. I have seen some students who carry their own laptops to school and sit on couches in study lounges; these students are only those who can actually afford a personal laptop. The computers at UT Arlington are somewhat insecure and lack the student-priority usage; non-students can freely enter the library and use a computer with a guest pass. Certain computers have broken or damage keyboards and mouses that need to be fixed. An example is that the keyboard-elevator underneath the keyboard on some computers have been broken. For some students, this makes typing an essay very uncomfortable because the keyboard does not angle up with student\\'s hands well. There have been several reports with problems on wireless access from using a laptop. Overall, I would still recommend students to use UT Arlington Library computers because they solve the students need for computersGreeks Are Just...There â€“ If you\\'re the type to party then fine. Unless you\\'re the type that likes to work hard then don\\'t be involved with one.The outdoors is great, but the thing is that there are lots of people walking around if you plan to do something outside.Everybody Loves Everybody â€“ There is no one in sight who is not friendly. All seems like close friends or family which is nice.No Car â€“ I don\\'t have a car but getting a ride from someone and seeing them take almost 45 minutes to park is really annoying. It defeated the purpose of getting a ride in the first place.Friendly People â€“ You see all types of people here and most are really friendly and nice. From your back home countryback kids to the surbanites, UTA has a good mix of everything.Expensive and Unhealthy â€“ We have a plaza where we have subway, panda express, sushi, pizza hut, and chick fil a. We don\\'t really have healthy options which isn\\'t good. Also the cafe food is even worse and without a meal plan you can\\'t get in.Most events are inside so as long as your okay to walk in the rain, your experience at the event won\\'t be too much ruined.Arlington, Tx â€“ There ae many things to do in Arlington if you make the best of what you have. the Rangers and cowbows stadium are not far from the university. Six flags an Hurricane Harbor are also near along with the Parks mall. Cooper st. is overflowing with different restaurants and shopping centers. as for cultural activities unless their on the campus there isnt much to do. I would feel pretty safe walking on the street by myself if I was near the campus because the Unitversity has its own police. The University also offers the Mavericks Ativites Center on campus that anybody can come to, but is free for students. The city doesnt really too much acknowledge the school or support it\\'s activities that I have seen.Business Management â€“ There is a greek fraturnity on campus that is especially for the businees major. They have study sessions and attend multiple netwoeking events. The teachers are also nice so far they aren\\'t as bad as expected if you actually attend class regularly. Exams are pretty easy if you put in the require studying time. Tutors are readily available and there are dozens of different study groups that would be willing to help. The College of Business also has workrooms where students can go to get help. Professors are easy to talk to and welcome you to get help during their work hours.The cost of some things are too high for most students that aren\\'t working or funded with helpful payment options. Although there are some good deals that you can get just have roomates in mind.Social Atmosphere â€“ The Greeks leave a great atmosphere with how social they are. Most of them are usually welcoming and helpful. They also throw great parties.My application and registration process was easy with the help of advisors. They are will to take the time to help you understand all that is needed to be successful.Not Party Central â€“ Public transportation is non-existent in this city, so party animals will have to drive themselves or pay for a cab. After dark around here there\\'s not a lot within even a 15-minute drive. Nestled between Dallas and Fort Worth, there are bar/club things to do, but not nearby, and not cheap.Could Be Worse â€“ Within a 15-minute walk of any edge of campus one can find two places serving alcohol, many of the usual fast food suspects, and also original, unique little places one will only find here. Several \"ethnic\" options are around, as well, for the large international student population and the rest of us who like hummus, curry, etc.So Far, So Lucky â€“ The campus is so \"quiet\" regarding crime and such it seems hard to imagine trouble, and the police and security services seem professional enough, but the place is wide open for any sort of mischief and seems to be riding on the fact that no one has wanted to try anything ... YET. If someone wanted to, they could cause a lot of grief on this campus, and that\\'s sad because it\\'s a nice place. Lighting after dark is pitiful. There are working, easy-to-see call boxes all over campus, but that only helps if you can get to one in the dark.Moderately Strict â€“ Discipline issues don\\'t seem to even crop up much. The campus can get loud from organized activities like step demonstrations and the like, but the student population seems to be mature, overall, and here to get a degree, not to party or cause trouble.What There Is Is Hidden â€“ I don\\'t do it, but I also never see it or hear about it. Even the usual reports and rumors about drug or alcohol-related incidents are almost non-existent. Even the Greek world seems to go easy on it.Getting Scarce â€“ Used to be plentiful access to both Macs and PCs, but the largest computer lab on campus was moved to another building and the number of PCs cut in half and the Macs completely discontinued. There are several places to go for PC use on campus, but when you need to find something or print something in a hurry you can be in trouble. There\\'s a decent, but small Digital Media Center in the basement of the Central Library for gimongous color prints and such, but likely to be a line.Not Bad â€“ In Summer there\\'s only one route (free, thought) - two buses orbit the campus so each stop gets hit every 15 minutes - 30 minute round trip on one bus. Spring and Fall there\\'s a second route (also free) that links to the first and take students to more restaurants, a Walgreens, etc. On weekends there are buses to and from a Walmart in the morning, and to a large local mall in the afternoon each trip costing $1 one way. The city itself is infamous for being the largest in the US with NO public transportation, so the school does what it can to help out.Not Enough â€“ I found a cheap place, bills paid, across the street from campus before they tore down hundreds of units on campus. There are new apartments built near campus but I haven\\'t visited them. They look nice, but also look expensive. On-campus apartments are small, but not cheap. Some have WiFi, maybe all. The dorms look nice in photos but I\\'m not a dormitory type guy. Half of the nearest apartments now are either very old and run-down, or expensive, even both.Not Bad â€“ The cafeteria is better than average institutional menu with vegetarian options and reasonable execution. Any place like it will \"miss\" now and then, but overall I like my meal plan. There are also options on campus for Starbucks, Panda Express, Pizza Hut, Subway, Chic-fil-A and even sushi. The small convenience store is also handy for Scantrons, toiletries, soft drinks and snacks.Intramurals Sports â€“ The intramural sports are big on campus. The are a fun way to get together and have fun with friends. Even if your team doesn\\'t win you have fun playing a game you like to play. I recently hurt my foot so I haven\\'t been able to eplay any intramural sports. The funnest intramural sport is playing football in the mud.Here in Arlington, most of the advisors are good. Some advise you on what they would do, so you could just ignore them. The people here are very nice and offer a lot of help. You really do have to put a lot of effort into your work because if you don\\'t, you will fail.  College is nothing like high school.I have been living in Texas my whole life so I\\'m pretty use to the weather changing. If you are not use to the weather changing constantly, then you would not want to go to a school in Texas period. The weather is always changing and it\\'s either really hot or really cold. Some people get sick when the weather changes so if you\\'re one of those people, I don\\'t recommend coming to Texas.There is a great diversity of all different races/ethnicies.  UTA does not discriminate against people\\'s religion or their background.  UTA is an open school and accepts all kinds of people.Its a very friendly area. You can get along with just about anybody on campus and their are a variety of different kinds of people their. Teachers are always willing to help when you need it.High School â€“ I am not currently in a Universtity. I am only taking a few dual credit classes their, so i dnt live on campus.This Is Not Your Preppy Party School â€“ While UTA is not a prestigious private school, it is also not a party school. You don\\'t really see the typical \"frat boys\" and \"sorority girls\" around campus. Everyone dresses normally, not too fancy. You don\\'t feel self conscious walking around campus in sweat pants if that\\'s the mood you\\'re in.For whatever you\\'re in the mood for: working out, playing a pick-up game of basketball, swimming, studying, eating...there\\'s a great place to do it. The Maverick Activities Center is huge, there\\'s a quite a few choices to get food, the library is very nice (not too quiet, but there is a silent floor if you like to study in silence), all of the dorm buildings have computer labs and study spaces. My main concern is that the food places are basically all in one building (except for one place, Einsteins bagels is on the other side of campus), so if most of your classes are on the other side of campus, you have to eat at Einstein\\'s or not eat at all.A City of So Much to Do, Yet So Little to Do â€“ Arlington has quite a few big things: The Cowboy Stadium, the Texas Rangers\\' Stadium, Six Flags, Hurricane Harbor...but all of those things cost a lot of money. There a few things for poor college students to do-there\\'s a mall nearby, and a nice shopping center called The Highlands with lots of restaurants. It\\'s also convenient that Fort Worth is so close as Fort Worth has a lot of things to offer.UTA being in Texas, the weather can get very tough to deal with. It gets extremely hot during the summer months.The greek life at UTA is great, everyone is very open and friendly. I have plenty of friends that are in greek life, and have been awsome. The parties they throw are good fun and they dont mind if you arent in the club.The Central Library â€“ The library is a great place to study and take time off between classes. The resources available are great, and the fact that it is open 24/5 is very helpful for studying late night.Most Diverse â€“ One thing that stands out at UT Arlington is the diversity.  UTA is the most diverse school in the UT system and in the metroplex.  Because of this, the school is constantly celebrating its diversity and recognizing all of the students ethnic backgrounds.There are always a number of activities going on campus.  There is a billiards club and bowling alley in the University Center.  There are several movies showing on campus every week.  Transportation is available to and from local shopping and malls.  The campus is also in close proximity to local pubs and restaurants.Not Safe â€“ I feel that the campus is not safe.  In the last year there have been numerous assaults and muggings in which University students were victims and the suspects are not students at UT Arlington.  Campus police have made efforts to warn students to be aware of their surroundings and have made themselves available as escorts to students and faculty but there still appears to be crime on campus.There Are Many Choices â€“ There are plenty of choices on what to eat at the UC and that\\'s about it. The only problem I have with that is that you have to walk such a long distance just to eat!The school spirit isn\\'t to great but their are some fans and supporters. Our teams are pretty good especially the volleyball girls and baseball teams.Off campus housing around UTA is good. Prices are convinient if you have a roomate. Safety is really good we have stations that with a press of a button we get help from the UTA Police; very helpful. Pros of off campus housing is the price, it is cheaper and you have your own kitchen to cook your meals. Another pro is that you dont have to pay for parking and waist gas money. A con is you dont get the dorm life experience.I think around campus there are good dinning options. There is a mall where food can be found, a chipotle, taco bell, fuzzy tacos, chinese food, and KFC; at affordable prics. Their are also student discounts in some of the restaurants and a good place to check out is Fuzzy Tacos. Delicious!The Social Life â€“ The social life at this school is very good. The students are very proud of who they are and they have to much maverick spirit. Also, there are parties very often.In the library there are plenty of computers for the students to use, but there are many students and they have to wait in the line in order to get the work done. The wireless connections are usually good.In the library there are plenty of computers for the students to use, but there are many students and they have to wait in the line in order to get the work done. The wireless connections are usually good.The parking spaces are very unusual to find. The students have to wait in the line for someone to pull out in order to park. There are some students that open the windows and ask other students and people if they are leaving so that they can follow them. Also, most of the parking spots are for students living in the campus. The cost for the regual daily parking is $2 per hour.Not on-Campus â€“ At least drug use is not too common on campus.  No one is going around offering drugs for sale.  If you find local friends though,  you could have outlets to start drinking and smoking fairly quickly.  You can do or abstain from whatever you want here.  B for options.Great Freshman Workload â€“ The core curriculum is fair and appreciated.  The numerous grad-students teaching first year english are really into their jobs and want you to do well.  As a student who wasn\\'t expecting much from the local college, I was blown away by its expectations of students to work hard and think critically.Only on-Campus â€“ Arlington is the largest city without public transportation.  However, there are consistent busses on campus and you can call a police escort at night to take you to your car/dorm if you\\'re worried.There\\'s a huge amount of diversity on the campus.  Everyone\\'s also very accepting of different ideas for the most part and doesn\\'t have to keep a guard - other than my roommate who introduces himself as an atheist and the warming \"you\\'re not going to judge me are you?!\".rnIn one of my classes, there was a Coptic-believing Egyptian and a Russian.  Both moved to America when they were twelve.rnInteresting people and views are everywhere!If you park in the wrong place or have your permit on the wrong side of the windshield - you will get a ticket.  Other than that, I haven\\'t seen any police giving anyone a hard time or bustin\\' parties.  They\\'re very helpful actually - just anal about parking.Many Options â€“ DFW has basically the best Texas sports teams: Cowboys, Rangers, Mavericks, and Stars.  Not into sports?  Dallas is filled with clubs and Fort Worth has the lively, western Billy Bob\\'s club.  Not into clubs?  Well you\\'ll find something here!  Suburbs like Arlington have the best prices and numerous job options for college students.Excellent Friends â€“ I met alot of awesome friends at UT Arlington, mainly due to their world-class activity center.The drug scene is almost nonexistant, i have never been pressured to use drugs.University of texas at arlinton is a school where everyone\\'s not afriad to come together and help each other. the professors help you in every way that they can before,during,and after class. the work isnt are people because it will be presnted in ways that you would understand. there are many popular areas that student hang out a like the libary and the student loungeExtreme Heat & Flood â€“ Our temp was over 100 and breaking records at the beginning of the school yr and then we had storms from the hurricane that reached us that flooded a couple of bldgs. On average the weather is not that bad though.Do Not Really Know Much About Police Policy â€“ I really have not experienced, seen, or heard much about police policy but I am sure if they saw someone drinking or doing drugs they would be in trouble.No Football Team â€“ No football but I am in marching band and we march at contests and other team games. We also have good basketball and other sports but I know a lot of people miss having a football team even though I do not.well i live in some apratments near campus so i have my car parked there and just walk to class.BUT all my commuting friends complain that it takes them around 25 mins to find a spot on campus.Students on Campus â€“ well, of course everywhere you go you know where you can find most of the attractive females and males: those who are involved in greek life.rnoverall, i would say there aren\\'t that many attractive guys. Some of the girls are decent. And then of course there is that one rare attractive down to earth guy in your class:)Technical Assistance â€“ The University of Texas at Arlington has many computers around campus, whether in individual colleges or in the main library. They recently got new MACS. The internet connection is fast and there are many printers in 2 of the floors in the library as well as in the individual colleges around campus. Basically if a student is in need of a computer, they are easliy assesable.Nothing major or special that I can even call out.Cowboys Stadium HERE! The new huge Dallas Cowboys stadium is here, along with the Texas Rangers baseball team, with them both being less than a 10minute drive from campus. The city has six flags, hurricane harbor, and so much more because it is very urban and in the city.New Gym.... GREAT! Newly renovated gym/student activities center is great. Very modern and state of the art. Can do homework by the computers or workout!The University offer at no cost to the students free rides to and from classes.Living on Campus â€“ I love my dorm and my room mates.  The dorm is centrally located in respect to my classesMaverick Place â€“ This is the best-rated off campus housing developement, and for good reason! This place is built with the student\\'s wants and needs in mind. It\\'s close to the UT Arlington campus, it is close to plenty of shopping areas and doctor\\'s offices, and the cost for rooms and amenities is relatively low! It is like a home away from home!Uta has a  good quality of food,but sometimes the prices are expensive.Security on Campus â€“ The university of Texas at Arlington has one of the best security , we have officer and staff securing the campus.The parking lots have the best officer securing our vehicles. I feel very secure when i am on campus.Looks Good â€“ the dorms look good but i live in the on campus apartments, which are not bad. but parking a big problem.Around TCC â€“ Although the prices of the restaurants around campus are not ideal, there is a small variety of options. Chapps, Firehouse subs, and OC burgers are in the immediate vicinity and are not bad choices. A few minutes away you can find many delicious restaurants such as chilis, TGIF, Carabbas, etc..I Like the School Environment, Though There\\'s Alot of People Smoking in Which I Dislike. i really want to go to another college in which would be suitable for me.Very Diverse â€“ This is a pretty diverse campus. There are students from all backgrounds. Minorities combined make up more than half of the student population.This is a pretty diverse campus. There are students from all backgrounds. Minorities combined make up more than half of the student population.Greek Row Is Nice â€“ Greek Row has many beautiful sorority and fraternity housing options, and everyone is definitely aware when it is Greek Rush Week on campus. However, apart from that, Greek life has little presence in day-to-day campus activities.No Football Team! We have an awesome, multi-million dollar gym, and great participation in intramural sports, but there is no football team! This causes a lower-than-normal level of school spirit. Students even walk around campus wearing other school\\'s t-shirts, caps, etc. However, we have a very recognized wheelchair basketball team! Great handicapped sports program.There is quite a bit of racial diversity - with a large portion of students consisting of those of Asian and Indian descent. Students come from a wide background of religions and beliefs, as well as economic backgrounds.UTA has a great Library that is 6 stories. There is a lot of room and you can always find a place to study even during finals week. UTA also has the Maverick Activities Center aka The MAC. The MAC offers a gym, an auditorium, a place to eat, pools, exercise classes, a computer lab, a place to study , and a place to lounge around and maybe play some pool.Basically Safe â€“ There are some incidents of crime but not too often. UTA does send out a message to all the students about the crime and how to avoid it happening to you.Prof Know Their Stuff â€“ The Professors at UTA in the Music department know what they are talking about. They are knowledgeable about their subject and it makes you feel that you are getting the most out of your classes.OMG! Parking is so limited. Prepare to walk ALOT. Right now with construction is going on, even more parking limitations. Parking permits are high (over 100 per year). If you don\\'t have a permit, be prepared to pay the fine. It\\'s a commuter school so people drive.I\\'m not much of a party girl. I\\'m clueless about what goes on regarding the party scene, but I do know that underage drinking is present. The responsible adults who work for the school and report such behavior just turn the other way and pretend nothing happened. There are some clubs. Transportation, well better get to know a friend who has a car. Public transportation is virtuall nonexistent.Study Areas â€“ The library has a wonderful environment to study with two quiet areas. There is also another area at the University Center to study with computers and in the weekend it closes later than the library. The couches makes it comfortable too.The surrounding town is the best part about UTA.  Arlington has the highest fast food per capita in the nation- which can either be a good thing or a bad thing.  Being so close to the metroplex, everything is within reach. The only real problem is, how will you choose?Good but Not Many Options â€“ I love the food on campus.  However, there isn\\'t enough to chose from.  After a year of nothing but on campus food it starts to get really boring.  West of Cooper there isn\\'t any food really.  Use the UC and I suggest the sushi!  Food in the cafe is $8.00 all-you-can-eat which is expensive for college students so I suggest only eating there if you have a meal plan.Easy Going â€“ The city is well located between Dallas and Fort Worth and close to major Airports (DFW and Dallas Love Field). Museums and amusement parks as well as stadiums for NFL, MLB, NHL, MLS, and NBA games are within the Metroplex area. Several other institutions of high education are well within the area, therefore giving access to some of the most advanced knowledge and technology in the world for education and career purposes.Welcoming Second Home â€“ UTA alumni welcome and are very helpful to incoming students. There are plenty of student organizations where students may ask for tutoring or simply enjoy their common interests with others while having free food. There are plenty of activities where students get the opportunity to meet and make new friends. Professors encourage attendance but are not strict about it. Professors announce study groups and encourage them.There are alot of dangerous neighborhoods but a few nicer places further away from campus. Traffic tends to get pretty severeThere Is No Such Thing â€“ Not only is there no public transportation at ALL! But to qualify earlier questions: there are exactly 7 (seven) places to eat not so nearby. And there are 2 bars in town the rest requre a 45 (fourty-five)minute tour to downtown Dallas or Fort Worth. Sorry to mix subjects on you.Strong Athletic Department. There is a great athletic life (that I\\'m not part of) but I can see that it is outragously popular.  The fans both outside our school and from within love our teams.Not Enough Where They Need Them. They might have one on every administrators desk but they dont have them in the labs and we would have to leave a lab to seek out a pc room to complete an assignment seeking computers.  We had a teacher tell us \"bring your laptops if you\\'ve got em\" that leaves potentially a large part of the lab hanging in the wind.Parking sticker cost too much and the availability of parking is ok but could build more places for students to park instead of faculty.Upperclassmen Dorms â€“ The Dorms at Univeristy of Texas at Arlington are in very good condition and are continuing to build brand new ones.Very Hot â€“ UTA is subject to Texas weather... extremely hot in the summer, humid, mild in the winter and the majority of spring thoughDrugs Are in Every College â€“ Yes, drugs (mostly marijuana) are at UTA.  But, I\\'m willing to bet you can get drugs at 99% of all colleges and universities in the U.S.  It basically depends how hard you look/ who you hang out with.Clubs East and West â€“ The University of Texas at Arlington is sandwiched between Dallas and Fort Worth (DFW).  There are several bars in Arlington, but for clubs you\\'ll want to go 20 minutes or so to Dallas in the East, or 25 minutes to Fort Worth in the West.Anything You Want â€“ At UTA I\\'ve noticed looks and dress are not of great importance, most kids are either trying to finish a degree or are commuter students. People walk around in mostly athletic wear and a lot of people ride bikes. The nightlife here isn\\'t as huge as most of the Texas schools, so it\\'s mostly the Fraternity life that focuses on social life.As a white female, I\\'m a major minority at this school. There is every race and religion around at this school so everyone must walk on egg-shells so as to not hurt anyone\\'s feelings. There are even certain times of the week where a certain race will meet up and hang out on campus, which I find a little odd.I came to UTA after being at UTSA for two years to pursue a nursing degree like my mother. Through the great advisors to helpful faculty I have finally found my place on campus as a lifeguard, swim instructor, and Spanish and education major. The campus is beautiful and I like the smallness of some classes mixed with other larger classes. There is virtually tons of opportunities for everyone at this school, any major, and degree, and almost any type of person/professor imaginable.Athletic Center â€“ The gyms and clubs offered at UTA are really good. There are different facilities for swimming, basketball,tennis,weights,clubs include martial arts of all kind.Love It! I have really enjoyed my time at UTA. It was a significant improvement from when I was first in undergrad, back in the early 1980\\'s!Campus Police on Top of Things. The campus police are well empowered and on top of things. I always felt safe. I especially like the disclosure aspect of their policies. If an incident occurs that is of snificant importance to the studunts/staff, a campus-wide email goes out right away, advising everyone of the event and what steps have been taken.Few and Far Between â€“ There are a few buses that drive around campus during the weekdays, and there is one shuttle that goes to a grocery and to a mall on the weekend, but other than that, there is nothing. Arlington is the largest city in the US without public transportation. It is hard to get around without a vehicle, so I suggest students make friends fast.Depravity Within Reach â€“ The housing is minimal, but it is very nice and affordable. However, dues are outrageous, and their activities often lack discretion. Excessive drinking is all but advocated, and it is central to most of the organizations\\' weekend activities. However, they do occasionally volunteer and and participate in dry activities such as intramural sports and campus-wide events. rnThe administration is not strict enough on these organizations, and I encourage all students I meet to join a professional greek organization rather than the drama and financial-burden of social greeks.Functional but Uninviting â€“ It serves its purpose, but it is really expensive for what it entails, especially since the most expensive dorms require that you purchase one. Since Arlington has no public transportation and there are no groceries in walking distance, pretty much any freshman without a car needs one, convenient for dining services. Also, if you eat the food as often as the meal plan suggests, I can pretty much guarantee you the \"Freshman 15\" and then some.Understanding for Commuter Students â€“ While the administration appears to prefer students who dorm, the professors and other students are very understanding of commuter students. This was very important to me because I teach piano out of my home and wanted to be able to continue this without feeling like an outsider for not dorming. One day the school even had free coffee and donuts for the commuter students.Decreased Computer Labs Cause Frustration â€“ UTA recently closed the main computer lab, Ransom Hall, to open a freshman advising center. There are now more computers available in the University Center, but it is difficult to study there because of the social atmosphere. It is almost impossible to find an open computer in the libraries during mid-terms and finals.UTA has a good wifi and there are restaurants with free wifi so bring your own laptop.You Will Find It Here! Apartment everywhere!  Old, new, good, bad, cheap, expensive...all that you can imagine.  Something for everybody.Why Arlington? Arlington is an entertainment capital! The UTA Mavericks are just 10 to 20 minutes away from all sorts of entertainment opportunities. Downtown Arlington offers is filled with art and music.  Maybe you want action...try Six Flags Over Texas or Hurricane Harbor.  Sports fans..how about the Rangers Ballpark or the Dallas Cowboy Stadium?  Lots of student discounts.  Don\\'t forget to give back...Mission Arlington provides many levels of service opportunities.It\\'s Just Like It\\'s Own Town â€“ The police force is pretty lenient on what goes on around campus. The only thing you really have to look for is parking tickets. They are definately a bunch of meter maids!Right down the street from the campus is the Parks Mall! It has everything to eat from vegan to fried chicken and from the dollar menu to the pull out your plastic. I love the convenience of having just about anything to eat right down the road.There are many parties to go to rather than anything else so if you are looking for some fun than parties are the thing to do.Apartments off campus is a great and easier way to live while in school. Actually it is a better idea to live in a apartment close to the campus than to live on campus because it is cheaper and not as many rules.Middle of the Day Is Crowed â€“ At times like around 9 to 10 o\\'clock all the computers are taken. If anyone needs a computer then he or she needs come in early to do so or wait until 3 or 4 o\\'clock to have one open for use. The printers are some times working fine then other times not at all. You will never know if they will be working when you need them to.They Are the Hype of the School â€“ Greek life is there to show how they live and act. They are usually the main attractions for the on campus parties. I would like to join because I see is as a opportunity to meet and greet new people.Easy Travel â€“ After viewing the campus I saw that it is easy to get around and if there were any location questions the students on campus are more than will to show and or direct you. I like to know that there are people who will help others to make their destinations.There is no public transportation system and no off-campus parking.I don\\'t know much about the drug scene. It is not prevalent, so one would have to search it out.DFW Area â€“ Dallas and Fort Worth provide a wide variety of activities, from the symphony to a large number of bars and night clubs.Beautiful Campus, Dumb Management â€“ It is an awesome place. Very beautiful campus. Students ROCK!!!, classes are ok. Management is not great. Socially active, lots of events, especially in Fall. Staying on campus is enjoyable, and convenient. No smoking or drinking on campus, which is fine. No Public transportation options - BOO!Girls Are Awesome! A lot of girls jog, walk around the campus, use the Activities Center, and keep fit and healthy. Most look intelligent, not just pretty. Some are especially active on campus dance team, drill, student groups, clubs etc. Great diversity of nationalities and races adds quality to the campus ;)(academic and non academic)... A few are outright awesome!I received a pretty good scholarship from UTA, it was about $8000 a semester, which is pretty good. I did not have any problems with forms, but I wish I did get more money.Great, With Exceptions â€“ I have had a great experience at UTA so far. There are some brilliant professors I have had the pleasure to work with, and there are wonderful students who are active in club activities. However, I am less than displeased about the couple of substandard professors I have had the misfortune of working with in the recent spring semester. It is unacceptable, in such an institution that is supposedly dedicated to higher education. Also, the administration, whether it be tech support, or some other department or other, is not very helpful. They are polite, but delightfully unhelpful in answering my questions. They need to change this, replaced the bad professors with better ones, and have a more helpful staff. Too bad the few substandard professors I had come into contact with are on tenure and can\\'t be removed. It is unfortunate that we are being ripped off in this manner. I will make the most of the rest of my experience and take care not to enroll in the classes where the professor has less than positive reviews.Finding parking is already hard enough without having to worry about getting parking tickets for random offenses. I have gotten a ticket for being a little over the line. If you take a walk through the parking lots, you will see University police keenly patrolling the area and putting ticket after ticket on students\\' cars. It seems as though the University is intent upon sucking the money out of us, whether it be in tuition fees or parking tickets and fines. That sounds bitter, I know. But it is true and it is unfair. I understand parking safely is important, but to deliberately look for minor offenses and issuing fines of $50 or $75 dollars is an abuse.I feel pretty safe on campus at UT Arlington, but we have been getting a lot of crime bulletins, so it\\'s kind of scary. But I feel pretty secure. I was kicked out of the library at 5 am one day, just because I had dozed off after my all-nighter. That made me feel pretty insecure about my safety, and also a little angry at the library administration. All the other buildings were closed, so I couldn\\'t even wait outside my classroom for my morning class to start. I wandered around until they opened the buildings at around 7 am. rnBesides that nasty event, nothing dangerous has happened to me at UTA.Advisors Are Extremely Knowledgable and Helpful â€“ The college nursing advisors are extremely helpful in picking courses and deciding which route one should take in the reaching goals quickly and efficiently.  They are to help with anything you need to know in your college experience.Need a Football â€“ I would say we are popular in terms of wheelchair basketball. Everything else is average. No football team = zero school spirit. Basketball is probably the hottest thing.The best thing about this campus is the diversity. There are different kinds of people from different countries and students coming from a wide variety of demographics.Connection Cafe/The Plaza â€“ The Plaza offers fast food restaurants like Subway, Pizza Hut, Chickfil-A, and a decent sushi place. rnThe Connection Cafe quickly gets old. They always have the Deli section, pizza, cheeseburgers. The also have a vegan section. Then there are two sections that changes. One of them is called Real Food on campus. It\\'s 50/50 chance you\\'ll like it. The other section either serves pasta or burrito/nacho/fajita place. Blue Bell ice cream is always available. There\\'s also a desert area that always has cookies. And there is also a salad bar. Next to it, the area offers some random and special stuff that could be dessert or main course. You can use your dining dollars at the Market, but it\\'s pricey. Also, Einstein Bros is amazing. Starbucks and a smoothie/milkshake place is there also. Meal plans are expensive and too much.There\\'s No Place Like Texas â€“ Although Texas weather is usually very unpredictable, it usually never affects my experience on campus.  Rarely does the campus close for a snow day; in that event, such time is a bonus for studying!  Although it is usually extremely hot, walking to campus is pleasurable as there is plenty of shade and pleasant scenery. When it rains, there are plenty of coverings so that hardly gets in the way either!Minimal Drug Usage â€“ Honestly, I have not noticed drug usage what-so-ever on campus.  Although I do not live on campus, I would assume that such usage would be visable.  In simply overhearing conversations, alcohol usage is present, but simply in the event of social gatherings.Fast Food Options â€“ Unless you intend on driving a few miles down the highway, the options around the campus are mostly fast food chains.  Inexpensive, yes.  Healthy, absolutley not. They don\\'t offer student discounts off-hand; they might if such discounts were requested. The best places to go, in my opinion, are Smoothie King, Ghengi\\'s Grill, and Subway.  Other than those options, you are looking primarily at Wendy\\'s or McDonalds.Greek life and the BSM are the best school activities. Fraternities and sororities are always up to something fun, interesting and new. The BSM is a place for students to worship God.We Have Jocks â€“ Sports at University of Texas at Arlington vary from basketball to baseball. We have intensive training and workout for the jocks. The turnout of every game is satisfactory.Very Simple â€“ They distribute financial aid directly to your student account so you don\\'t have to worry about anything.Parking is okay. I would go 10-20mins early, just in case though because sometimes parking is a pain to look for. I believe they are building another parking-lot so there should be less problems now.Bring a Car â€“ The campus is pretty nice but if you don\\'t have a car then you have nothing to do in your free time other than stay on campus. Bring your car otherwise you are going to be relying on other people for everything.Campus and Off Campus Apartments â€“ The housing at this campus is just wonderful. Whether you are on or off campus, you feel right at home. I love it.!Walking is the quickest and easiest way to get around school. sometimes even riding a bike helps, but dont too many people do that. Either way the exercize is good for you :)A Great Town â€“ Coming from a small town and going to Arlington was the best decision i\\'ve ever made. There is so much to do. The atmosphere is totally different here than my hometown. They have many off-campus apartments so there\\'s a lot to choose from and also Six Flags is next door. who couldn\\'t love that! :)The UTA computer labs have been very helpful to me. I am currently in need for my own personal laptop, but the computer labs have been a good alternative. The computer labs in my dorm allowed me to print as much as I needed as long as I provided my own paper. The $100 that is automatically loaded on our MavID is helpful when I have to print documents in the computer labs around campus. The only complaint I have is when the software was  being updated this past semester. For about a week of two we were unable to print in the computer labs, but besides that I think that the computer labs on campus are extremely helpful and convenient.We Are All the Same â€“ Being Hispanic, I found UTA a very nice place.  I don\\'t feel any discrimination due to religion, ethnic, political background, others.  The process is the same for all.  No difference.  Of course, it is a big college; hence, a lot of \"road blocks\" but nothing to do with the above reasons.  Just regular, public, big, college.Getting to Eat When You Remember â€“ There are plenty of places around campus to get late night snacks.  I like this college since it is in the middle of the city and everything kind of grew up around the college.  If you can\\'t find anything open in side campus you can walk about 5 minutes and find Fast Food Restaurant that serve until about 2:00 am or so.The Great Commons Area â€“ Enjoy this area, different suppliers, Pizza-Hut, Subway, Wendys, Starbuck Coffee, others.  In our busy days we can enjoy different kind of food, that is you don\\'t like the UTA cafeteria food which I believe it is also good, fresh, and hot.  We have a \"fun\" area that we can play pool and enjoy a free time with my classmates or make new friends.  Here you will find those friends that got lost (inside the college) at the beginning of the semester and that now you can see their faces, even though they are sometime your roomates  (kind of funny but real).Appropriately Strict â€“ The residence halls are very strict in terms of underage drinking and drug use. If you have any sort of conscience, though, you\\'ll understand that this is a GOOD thing. The RA\\'s and residence administration crack down on these things for a reason - drugs and underage drinking have no place in education. It doesn\\'t help the students, and it doesn\\'t help the university\\'s reputation.rnrnAs for parking, the campus police services are out patrolling each parking lot almost every day and will ticket anyone without a parking sticker for $55.00 - over half the cost of the parking sticker. So get one, or face a hefty fine every day. The upside: You never have to register your license plate(s) with the University, so they never can connect your name with your car(s). Therefore, they can cite YOUR CAR 100 times but cannot make you pay the fine because they don\\'t actually know the owner. YOU have to go to the campus police department with the ticket and fine. It\\'s somewhat laughable. They also threaten to tow after the third citation, but that also never happens.rnrnAlso, while there are rules that dictate smokers should stand x-feet from the building when lighting up, most students do not abide because the social hotspot corners and sitting areas are inside that range. This rule is never enforced. You can more or less smoke wherever you please, except indoors of course.rnrnAll-in-all, as a resident or commuter, restrictions for students are appropriate. However, opinions might polarize when UTA becomes a smoke-free campus very soon.Mostly Safe â€“ From my point of view, the safety at UTA is about what you expect in an overgrown city where the campus is more like infrastructure than architecture: major roads bisect the campus, high schools and children\\'s parks parallel the grounds; the city simply outgrew itself. However, you will rarely walk from the parking lot to class without seeing a police cruiser or bike cop stroll buy.rnrnIt does make you feel safer. Although, there have been about a half dozen crime reports from the University administration during the last two semesters. These were my first two semesters at UTA, and although I have not been victim to any on-campus crimes (assault and theft have been among the most popular) so I cannot attest for the severity, I will say that I feel safe 9 times out of 10.rnrnI have a lot of long days, often working until 9 or 10 pm and sometimes later, and parking availability dictates I park almost a mile from the Fine Arts building where all of my classes are held. So I DO think it is important that I feel safe during that obnoxiously long walk.rnrnThis might be the only department in which UTA takes a hit. Police patrol at night seems to be thin - at least from MY point of view. I walk the same path every day between FA and the parking lot, so I might just have a limited line of sight on their activity. For the most part, I do feel safe in the lit parking lots and the popular street I take - Greek Row. The emergency pillars (whatever they are called) that allow you to press a button for help are everywhere, thankfully. Do they work? No idea. Since about 3 or 4 dot my path every day, I sure hope so. From what I\\'ve been told, they are well-maintained, especially since there has been a rise in crime on campus and in Arlington in general.The only major challenges that weather presents are that when it rains UT Arlington tends to become a water park. Forget walking to class, you could use the sidewalks and grass as a slip \\'n\\' slide! Most of the time Texas weather means sunshine and a cool breeze thats perfect for a pick up game of frizbee in front of the library. On freak ocassions there are snow or ice storms but that is a one way ticket to freedom from class: Snow Day!The nightlife scene is primarily for students older than 21, although there are quite a few hang outs for the non-legal students. Some of the most popular parties are held at Sherlocks Irish Pub and J. Gilligans Bar. Alot of departmental clubs and after class parties take place in the Highlands where there\\'s Black Finn Bar and the ever popular drink and play place Dave and Busters. Other nighttime activities would be playing a few games of bowling at Splitsville or AlleyCats. Other options include the Rangers ballgames or catching a Cowboys season football game.Parking Is a Pain! The parking at UT Arlington is rough, even though they added almost 400 new parking spots to try and keep up with the growing student body. They have shuttles that can take you from the furthest parking to central locations of the main campus but they are scheduled to run by the parking lot stations every fifteen to twenty minutes. There are plans to construct a newer parking garage that would have a higher capacity than the older one that is limited to four levels that requires a special parking pass.Great Education â€“ UTA is a great place to attend school on a reasonable budget in addition to setting myself up for success in life. Thanks UTANot your typical Greek lifestyle found here, education based.Working Folk â€“ General older working fold seeking higher education.UTA, along with, I would conceive, every university, has a strict academic policy.  A policy that stringently specifies that academic dishonesty and fabrication, will not be tolerated.From my observance, I would have to rate the professors for whom I have taken with a grade of a B+.  THe reason I rate them with B+ instead of an A is because I am the type of student who does not really need the help or assitance of his professors,and who figures, and solves everything he encounters on his own.  Not to say that the professors for whom I have taken are not great at what they do, it\\'s only to say that they do the job required of them and nothing more, from my perspective, because I am competent, intelligent, and fully cogent enought to comprehend any and everythiing I encounter independent of my professors.Campus Wide Variety â€“ They offer a campus wide variety which has encorpoated the fast food indusrty with the cafateria experience. You can have access to the fast food world if you cannot make it to the cafateria. The down side is that there is not a healthy alternative if you are looking for this choice. The cafateria is the only place where the student has access to the healthy choice.Game Day â€“ Game day is what we live for. The atmosphere, the friends, the yelling, etc.Non-Existent Drug Scene â€“ The drug scene at school is non-existent. Drinking is a tad bit more popular, but it\\'s never really seen out in the open, since big consequences will be dealt with if caught. If there is drinking on campus, it will be very hidden and not a lot of people would openly know about it.Most of the time, UTA throws parties, mainly hosted by Greeks at Arlington clubs. Most of the time they are pretty cool, but it sucks when the club rips the promoters out of the money and the partygoers have to suffer for it. That doesn\\'t happen a lot, but it has a couple of times. All in all, the parties are usually good. The best thing to do is to go to a school party to have the most fun because some house parties aren\\'t worth it.Arlington Highlands â€“ The Arlington Highlands is a place for college students to hang out during the week, nights, or weekends. It has a variety of places to hang out, eat, and have a good time. A couple of places Arlington Heights has to offer are Dave & Busters, Splitsville Bowling, Red Robin, Improv Comedy Club, Pluckers Wing Bar, and Chuys. The prices are pretty average as any other restaurant.Its Been Great So Far! Love the efficiency. Friendly staff. Large Campus. Plenty of activities.Great Diversity! An even mix of folks from all races.As someone that lives off campus I enjoy it because I am still close enough to campus that I can enjoy the campus. The cons would be not being able to be on campus all the time and meet new people.I would say the one downside of this University is that fact that it is in an area that is not seen as the best area of town. You can hear of shootings and gang things, but I guess that can almost be found in any city. The sad thing is that I do not feel comfortable walking around campus by myself after 5 o\\'clock.There is a vareity of computers on the campus which is nice because no matter what type of computer you are use to using there is a good chance you will find it on campus. I love the speed of the wireless networks on the campus they are some of the best I have ever used.I Think It\\'s Average â€“ I don\\'t know much about other campuses so I think it\\'s pretty average here, but can be boring.The campus isn\\'t really designed for bad weather and when it happens it can be hard to get around.Crowded, but You Can Work Around It â€“ As long as you are willing to get there a little early you can get a descent, if not good parking spot.Arlington Texas â€“ Arlington Texas is a big town with lots of people. Although there isn\\'t much to do, the things that are available to do here are very worthwhile and nationally known. University of Texas At Arlington is a very great college to attend and if weekend fun is needed you should go to the Highlands for food and fun or to the Parks mall at Arlington, the two places where no matter how much you go you can\\'t seem to get enough of.Review of Facilities â€“ The food in the cafe isn\\'t very good but, the food from the resturant\\'s are good.Greek Life â€“ The greek life at UTA is that girls don\\'t talk to other girls unless they are in the greek system. They don\\'t give anyone else the time of day unless it is during rush and being super fake. I think they should be nice and inviting all year round not just for one week and then start acting fake again, I don\\'t understand that one bit.Registered nurses (RNs), regardless of specialty or work setting, treat patients, educate patients and the public about various medical conditions, and provide advice and emotional support to patients\\' family members. RNs record patients\\' medical histories and symptoms, help perform diagnostic tests and analyze results, operate medical machinery, administer treatment and medications, and help with patient follow-up and rehabilitation.Financial Advisors â€“ When I applied for a scholarship I did get it it wasn\\'t so bad concerning the process its just the faxing or the mailing your stuff back to them that took up a bit of time when driving over there.There are a lot of parking spots you just have to make sure you park at the right places near your classes.I Love My School â€“ The price is reasonable. The teachers are great. The students are really nice.Parties Happen but Not on Campus â€“ Not a lot of parties occur on campus. The ones that do are usually wholesome.Where Should I Park? There are specific parking lots for students, but the ones closest to the College of Business always fill up quickly and campus police is quick to give students parking tickets if their parking permits aren\\'t current.Lack of Support at Athletic Events â€“ Not enough students come out to the athletic/sporting events.  We have a great tennis and basketball teams but not enough students care to attend the matches/games.A 24-hour lab is lacking on campus.  The library is only open 24 hours from Sunday through Friday at 8pm.Absence Policy â€“ UTA has an abscence policy. If you miss more than three classes your professor can begin to drop your grade. I love this rule because only the people that care some to class and those that don\\'t care get punished for it.The library and library assistants at UTA are really great and resourceful. There are several campus activities and generally campus aesthetics are okay but saftey is still a huge problemVery Social and Plenty to Do â€“ Throughout the week UTA has a variety of events and activites available for students.  The people here are generally friendly and welcoming.  One of the greatest areas we have is the Mavericks Activities Center (MAC).  This place offers a variety of excercise equipment, multiple indoor tracks, basketball courts, and much more.A Variety of Options â€“ Generally, transportation is readily available around campus.  A system called \"Mav-Mover\" is especially great for late night travel.  Just call them and they will send someone quickly.  There are also buses which make routine rounds around campus. On Saturdays, these buses will also transport students to Wal-Mart and the Parks at Arlington at the price of one dollar.The cost is pretty high but its pretty decent livingYou can\\'t really blame the campus for the weather. Texas weather has a mind of its\\' own so it\\'s always nice to carry an umbrella and such. I just wish there were more portals to keep up with the weather.Everyone is different here. I can walk down and see so many cliques but yet everyone hangs out with everyone.I have a job on campus and I love working there. The people are so helpful and kind.Police are quick to respond on campus. I feel okay walking alone at night.I live living on campus, close to all my classes and I don\\'t have to drive all the way back home to Allen. People at my dorm are very friendly ans outgoing. The dorm themselves are spacious and not that bad.I am not really part of Greek life but the people are very nice.We have great school spirit, but no football team.I had a pretty great experience here in my first semester. The students are very friendly and approachable. The teachers want to help you succeed.I\\'ve had experiences with \"bad\" professors and \"good\" professors, which is to be expected. However, most professors want students to learn and have a passion for teaching their classes in a way that will help students learn more.There have been issues with campus safety in the past year, but I think that the campus policy has been working on enforcing security a bit more to achieve a safer campus. Although, the campus focuses a bit more on parking than security at times.Greek life hosts and participates in a lot of the social events on campus that can be fun.There is no football team, which is a downside, but there are a variety of campus sports, such as basketball, volleyball, etc., that make up for the absence of the football team.The campus is very diverse, so you are able to meet people of different ethnicity on a daily basis, which is pretty cool and not something that many schools out there have. Getting to learn about different cultures while studying is a nice and unique combination. The professors that I\\'ve had are very interested in the subjects that they teach and try to help.The Criminology and Criminal Justice department offers several guest speakers and a job fair to help students with job prospects.The majority of professors in the Criminology and Criminal Justice department have actually worked in the law enforcement field, and will use examples from their experience to teach their classes. This makes it easier to understand the material. The professors care about their students and want to see them succeed. The only problem is the liberal arts departments are typically overlooked by the University and do not get much attention.There have been a lot of robberies in the parking lots. I barely seen any cops patrolling the parking lots especially at night.I\\'ve had some really great professors that I\\'ve learned a lot from, and they really cared about our auccessThere are a lot of research opportunities readily available for science majorsWe can call the cops if we are scared to walk alone at night, and they will escort usRelatively cheap to join, but they don\\'t have a large presence in our achoolWe have a really cool gym, and swimming pool. There are also a lot of activities available to usI like the diversity of my school. However, professors are usually hit or miss. Some professors really care about their students while others only teach because they\\'re given research opportunities.There are a few food joints near the school like Chipotle and McDonalds and they\\'re always busy because well it is near a school campus full of hungry people. Sometimes, it\\'s nice to just order the food to-go then eat on the school\\'s campus.No to Drugs â€“ Drug activity is not a major issue at UT Arlington, just depends on the crowd your around and what their intentions are. Overall its a casuality to drink.The University of Texas at Arlington offers a nursing program which is excellent for those with the intended major. The professors are hands on with the students.Life in Arlington â€“ Arlington is town that is growing everyday with the new mall and different restaurants. The University of Arlington offers a excellent business school for those interested in that major. When you visit stop and shop around the Highlands Mall.They try to accommodate everyone at their comfort level but they can not be everywhere all the time.I like how you are consistent getting email communication asking about your plans where are you in your goal accomplishments.Due to the fact I am an online student so campus life is not something I can adequately speak on. But my overall experience has been okay and I\\'m happy I choose UTA to attend.I feel safe at school but I am not sure that everyone does.I stray away from the greek life, I know that it is prominent in my school and the ones who participate seem to enjoy.By the athletic department I first think of the gym and it is nice but somewhat packed so I use an external gym.The school lacks a little bit of spirit and I think that is based on having no football team. Other than that I think that there are very fun and interesting activities that make the school fun. I enjoy that because it helps take the stress load off.UTA is the 5th most diverse school in the nation. Everybody is welcome to your social circle, no matter what ethnic background your coming from.Of course in any campus you go there will be drinking or drugs, its common for young adults to use. So far my experience has been great, my friends request me to drink but never really pressure me.Super fun! It feels exactly like if I was part of a movie. I never expected to actually be that way. The best thing about it, is that they use the Fraternities and Sororities as a form of network for future job search. The alumni are very helpful and successful making that transition from  a university to real life that much easier.We don\\'t necessarily have a sport that is well known in this school but our activity center is pretty cool. If you are just trying to be fit and go to a gym without having to pay that gym membership fee, then your set. It has a basketball court, a track, weightlifting machines, the whole 9-yard.It\\'s a fun school so far. I am glad I decided to transfer here from my community college. It\\'s very diverse so I have met different people from different ethnic backgrounds, so many activities to chose from. Can not wait to join greek life as well.I love my professors and there are many student centers with wifi, computers, access to cafes and overall great spaces to study.I\\'m happy to be on a campus where I\\'ve interacted with people from all parts of the globe, it\\'s refreshing.I don\\'t really associate enough with dorm parties or organizations to know about the personal recreational experiences of other students.My department is Spanish/Modern Languages so there are a variety of courses but it\\'s not flexible because the courses are only offered once a year or in times that may conflict with my work schedule. The east side of my campus looks like it stayed in the 1970s but the west side for architecture and the north area for engineering has beautiful up to date buildings. I understand why nursing and engineering are the focus of my campus however I wish course variety/flexibility extended to my department more than anything.Although our school has done a lot to combat this safety issue such as provide free escorts to students who are walking long distances to their vehicles, it still seems as though there are constant armed robberies on campus ground and in surrounding areas. This part of Arlington in general unfortunately is known for these kind of crimes. There are a decent amount of police officers but to be quite honest they seem more concerned with parking tickets than actually patrolling the campus for safety. I say this because the alerts we receive regarding assaults or robberies show up in my e-mail practically every 3 to 5 months.My professors in particular have been the most helpful in regards to informing us about what internships we qualify for, however the career services on campus tend to offer more opportunities with the engineering and nursing department more than others.I wouldn\\'t know I don\\'t have student housing, I commute to school.I\\'m not affiliated with any Greek life groups so I can\\'t really say.The University of Texas is the fifth most diverse university in the nation and that is a great achievement to all of us. The vast mixture of cultures and students bring a new vibrancy to the campus and offers opportunities to make new connections with people of all backgrounds. The campus is a nice size that\\'s not overly huge and is a big commuter school. There are tons of active organizations as well as sororities and fraternities that students can be a part of and we definitely do not condone hazing of any kind. UTA also has a health services that assist students with all types of concerns from immunizations to mental health and counseling. And a big plus is the awesome library that has so many resources that can help you with classes, exams, studying, research, etc. I really enjoy attending UTA and I hope many others do as well whether they\\'re current or future students.I like the diversity on campus. A lot of different cultures and regions are represented, which makes for a better learning environment in my opinion. There is a lot to do in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area if you are interested in off campus life and experiencing different cultural things.The classes are traditional for those of us that like the classroom scene and the activities that are available are always super fun to do.I like the attitude that the campus radiates as it helps make freshmen like myself feel welcome and comfortable and adjust pretty well into the campus life, the only thing I wish would be change is the notice for tuition payments as they can be usually close and dont give you notice until it is very close but other than that it does create a great environment to be studying in.Great school with fantastic teachers and a beautiful campus! I just wish that the environment was centered more around the students than the research that the school conducts.UTA has been one of my favorite places. Everyone is so friebdly there and the premed program is awesome. Nothing to change.Good campus, great instructors, beautiful campus. I was really nervous because in high school I always heard of professors who didn\\'t cared if you passed or not, but the teachers there proved me wrong.UT Arlington is great, but it could use a little more improvement.  I feel that the staff only care about the money, while it is the students who help each other succeed.The University of Texas at Arlington is a very professional and friendly campus. I wouldn\\'t change a thing about it.University of Texas at Arlington is a fantastic school. Its faculty is skilled and helpful. The only complaint I have is that, even though it\\'s a \"commuter school,\" there is insufficient parking on campus.A decent sized university but doesn\\'t really have the true college feel. Very affordable, campus is small enough that you won\\'t ever have to walk 20 minutes across campus.I really liked my time at UTA so far! The music program is fantastic! I learned so much from the interaction from the professors and the small size of the classes! There are some core classes I loved as well outside the music program! Very open minded and diverse school! I will say that the amount of core classes one must take for their major is a bit much, but I do get the concept of trying to prepare students to be ready for anything!The school itself is fairly nice, I just think they are a lot of talk and little action. They always talk about how great the school is but it just seems average, they don\\'t treat us exceptionally well, or poorly and the academics don\\'t seem to be anything extremely special.The environment is great, haven\\'t experienced any trouble, there is a lot of diversity/ethnicity and most importantly, great professors!Smoking and drug use on and around campus is open and evident. The university lacks a variety of affordable meal options, especially for commuter students. Everything in the campus bookstore is extremely overpriced. UTA charges out-of-state students over twice as much as in-state students for tuition. An online course program is basically nonexistent. The university does little to accommodate the needs of commuter students. Politically, the university is very liberal. On the other hand, I would say the academic program is rigorous, and if you know who to ask, you can easily find out which professors are better to take than others. UTA does have a few really swell profs. I also found other students to be friendly in general, which is a plus. Overall though, I wish UTA wasn\\'t such a money-drainer in day-to-day life.This school has A LOT to offer and they are very good at making everyone feel welcome and comfortable. The only thing i don\\'t like about this school is the parking.I like how diverse the campus is and the price of my education, but  everything else is rather lackluster, this is a commuter school and it is obvious; the campus/social aspect of college is hurt because of this. The people who attend here keep to themselves and are obsessed  more with their phones than interacting with others. I have never felt more alone whilst being surrounded by thousands of people. The professors are hit or miss and the facilities are okay. Overall a \"meh\" schoolI enjoy going to UTA. I think it is best to be involved with some kind of organization in order to enjoy the full affects of what UTA has to offer! Overall, in my experience, it is a great school to transfer to.Well I\\'m still currently enroll at the university. I love the place I just transfer there this past fall semester. The professors were outstanding, they were a lot of help. Also they have great food in campus, there\\'s a buffet and its very cheap which is very beneficial for students who are always brokeThis school was the best decision ever! I love UTA so much It is very diverse and everyone is so respectful! I love my professors they are all very eager to help when you are facing problems. I wouldn\\'t choose any other school. Go Mavs!I am not exactly involved in many sports however I really enjoyed the vast array of services provided by my school gym.I have been blessed in that I have been provided amazing mentors who have given me a great deal of insight over the subjects I have studied as well as provided me great deal of service learning opportunities.in order to advance my professional experience.There are opportunities for campus and off campus work by word of mouth from professors or organizations.Greek life plays a moderate role at the university, but is not pushed on students.I haven\\'t attended any sporting events for the university, but they consistently notify students of any upcoming events to encourage attendance.I have had a good share of bad and good professors, but I ultimately feel that I chose a wonderful school and program. I\\'m happy to become alumni of a school that serves such a vast amount of students.The diversity is one of the best things about the campus. It presents opportunities for everyone to find a partner.The policies at UTA are extremely poor and the punishment process is a total joke that just wastes everyone\\'s time.There is a lot of car lot robberies which makes me feel unsafe at night walking to my car!The school is very unique with a lot of diverse studentsSo far the two years ive attended its been greatI dont live on campus but from my friend its pretty okay..Sports isnt really talked about at UTA..UTA is a very diverse school, you will meet so many people.I try to avoid these situations by staying in once its really late or having a friend walk me half way to my room.The class sizes are exactly what I expected. And the professors are very nice.I really like were I stay everything is good. But the only downfall is that the MAC is all the way across campus.I want to join the NPHC and they do not have houses. Their houses are all the way in Dallas instead of on campus. But I do plan on joining pretty soon.I have not been to a Basketball game at UTA yet but this upcoming year i d plan on going. Because I\\'ve heard great things about them.It\\'s a great school for me. Because there aren\\'t many parties or too much violence. I love this school and I\\'m so glad that I chose it.Campus crime used to be a bigger issue in past years, however in the time that I have been at Ut Arlington only 3 times have I heard of crime happening.We may not have a football team but our basketball team is Great!My overall experience at Ut Arlington has been wonderful so far. I transferred from Texas A&M college station and honestly it was the best decision I\\'ve made for my education. If I could go back to senior year in high school I would have gone to Ut Arlington instead of Texas A&M. The students are friendly, the school spirit is also present, and this university has had a marching band without a football team for over 30 years. They are the UT Arlington ambassadors.Everywhere I went I saw a security officer and that would make me feel safe. Walking towards my car I will always pass an emergency contact pole and that felt very comforting also.My adviser and the Career adviser told me they would help me look for a job or internships if i needed help, so that is very comforting to hear.Overall, my experience was great. Sure I was nervous but my semester was great i had good grades and made good friends.I did not apply for campus housing but I would like to someday apply when I need to.I\\'ve met a friend that is apart of  great sorority and she describes it as an amazing experience. Unfortunately, we met after enrollments were done but I would not mind joining a sorority in the future.I have seen the athletic facilities but, I still need to find my motivation to join in for a membership and workout.I would say that my overall college experience is okay. Reasons why would be that I can be pretty shy of a person in new environments and I wont speak much until I feel more comfortable with my surroundings. They have a lot of clubs for students to join and the people are very friendly. The professors were friendly but I didn\\'t feel comfortable asking questions when I didn\\'t understand the topic we were learning.If you like powerpoint presentations, you\\'re home!It\\'s diverse, in regards to population, but the overall mentality is white-washed suburban god-fearin texan.UTA is UT\\'s jealous little brother. The core curriculum faculty is horrible. The upper-level courses are bland and are the polar opposite of subversive.UTA is vet friendly. That was the reason I chose the school.Professors are great. Because its a research school, you\\'ll always learn up to date material and the professors I\\'ve had are always very smart. It\\'s also pretty easy to get involved in research. Just ask a professor you like!I believe this campus is one of the most diverse in Texas. So many religions, races, ethnicities, sexualities, etc. It\\'s easy to find a group you fit with, and even easier to learn more about other groups.Parking sucks. Crime sucks. Professors are great. Classes are alright. It\\'s small campus-wise but classes can be very large. It\\'s easy to get involved if you make an effort and join organizations.Security is an issue. Crime has been awful this semester and I avoid being alone on campus now. As far as sexual assaults, there aren\\'t many I\\'m aware of. It\\'s more stabbings and robberies. Also, a cop got shot this year.Do not live in Centenial Court!! Nasty place. My boyfriend stayed there and it was awful. I stayed at Campus Edge and it is worth the money. Clean and nice space. The dorms I\\'ve been in visiting friends weren\\'t the bed  VERY smallThe MAC, which is open to all students, is a great place to find any kind of sport or workout. The huge basketball court is really cool too.As the classes get more specific, the class sizes goes down. I find that more helpful for teachers to help students when the topics get more difficult.There are more opportunities for business majors but health or science related majors don\\'t have as much opportunities.Crime has occurred any time of the day. There needs to be constant police patrolSome of them do charity work and I can respect that.There were great professors that were passionate about what they taught that overshadowed the less competent teachers. There are lots of extracurricular activities to do when you need a break from studying.We don\\'t have a football team, therefore, school spirit is low.I think it is moderateI haven\\'t looked into any internshipsHave not started yet but have heard it is goodI don\\'t plan to stay at the dormsI haven\\'t looked to much into fraternities but I would like to maybe join oneI haven\\'t talked looked too much into that departmentI haven\\'t started the school yet but I plan to attend during the fallSafety on campus is not an issue. Security is everywhere and is readily available when in need.Many companies and employers come to campus to recruit students for the workforce. I would say a degree from UTA is very greatly valued.Professors are always there for the students. Courses are very creative and are very fun to explore. Most classes are relatively small and are more focused on the individual student.Everyone on campus is involved in sports. Whether it is playing them or cheering them on, everyone is somehow involvedUT Arlington is a very diverse and very welcoming campus. Professors put in the best effort for their students to learn and they provide adequate information when necessary. If I had to go back and look at schools all over again, UT Arlington would definitely be on my list.Health and Safety is an important feature of UTA. Sexual assualt, voilence is taken seriously. Similary, the campus has a health centre easily accesible to the students.UT Arlington graduates have large prospects of job and employment. Many graduates go to big companies to work after their degree completion. Some get admitted into bigger school for higher education. Overall, its just great!UT Arlington graduates have large prospects of job and employment. Many graduates go to big companies to work after their degree completion. Some get admitted into bigger school for higher education. Overall, its just great!It is sometimes really hard to get housing on campus. It is also not so spacious.The Greek life is overall okay. There are lots of organization on campus representing greek life.Student usually participate in atheletics, our school has a strong basketball, base ball and a football team. Apart from those, there are many atheletics oppurtunity in campus.University of Texas at Arlington is very diverse campus with lots of major you can choose from.  The education system is one of best among UT system. With affordable and resonable CoA and lots of scholarship oppurtunity, it is easy for many students to afford the college.The college of business is commendable.It was easy to navigate.They made it super easy, I have a counselor that calls every week to discuss class schedulesI haven\\'t had too much experience with the athletics because I am an online studentThere are crime reports that happen around campus, but they usually happen on the outskirts or near very secluded spaces. The police are easy to contact since the school gave its students phone numbers regarding campus safety.My classes varied, depending on that type of curriculum that was taught in each class. My language classes were small, and I was able to interact with the teacher well enough. My science-based classes were large, so it was hard to interact with the teacher, but as long as I stay focus on the material taught, I\\'m well okay.In terms of the curriculum, I was able to learn what is benefited for me for my major. I was able to do well in my classes when I found the time to study. The University of Texas at Arlington is one of the most diverse universities in the country, so I was able to see individuals from different ethnicities and backgrounds everywhere on campus. Since I live off-campus, it was very hard for me to find individuals who share my interests to interact with, but there are a lot of organizations on campus that helped me find people to interact with. I would choose this school again if I could do it all over because its tuition rates are lower than any other school in Texas and its nursing program is really commendable.UTA has a multitude of cultures that adds to the richness of the college experience.I am a little fearful while walking to my car at night. There have been many reports of robberies in parking lots. Students have been held at gunpoint many times. Sexual assault has been reported near campus. There are definitely more robberies than assaults at UTA. The police are very hard working people who make sure our campus is safe. There is a service they provide to escort those who parked far late at night.The career center is very helpful and willing to steer you into the right path. I have a friend who is unsure of her major and needed some assistance. The career center was more than happy to help her and she is in the process of choosing her path.UTA grew on me. I love being on campus and just studying. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing. The professors are passionate about their subjects and always willing to help when there is a misunderstanding. Communication is easy and quick. Class sizes are huge, the lecture halls are always packed with students. The courses offered are plenty with many time slot options.I do not live on campus, but have visited some of the on campus facilities which is how I rated them above.Greek life students are very active around campus and events they do to better the community. Every week there is an event to benefit the community in some way such as bake sales, fundraisers, information booths, etc.Basketball is one of the most hyped up sport at UTA. Volleyball would be the next sport with the most attendees and fan support. They are fun events to attend. Our athletic facilities are very clean and tidy.The University of Texas at Arlington is considered the fifth most diverse campus in the United States. I chose this college because of the accredited nursing program. They also have other programs such as engineering and business. I feel very comfortable at this campus because ethnically, I am a minority. The students and staff here are very friendly and helpful. The staff goes to work everyday with a smile on their faces.UTA takes the sciences and math very seriously which I can appreciate. The staff is really helpful in all areas (financial, advising, etc). rnrnI basically live in the chemistry clinic created by Dr. Rogers at UTA. It\\'s free and there are chem tutors who know they\\'re stuff that help out. It\\'s a great place to study.UTA is like the 3rd most diverse school in the nation.Housing is pretty expensive and there are only like two nice dorms out of the entire campus. Reasons why I commute lol. Apartments are expensive too.Our teams are really good at what they do. We have sone very talented athletes. However our school spirit is very low lol.I\\'m not a Greek not do I care to become one. I like to volunteer on my own not with organizations. Also they seem so insignificant aside from just planning events I do not care to attend at school. People have mixed feelings towards the Greeks at UTA. Although it\\'s not my thing, I can agree their housing is safe and plentiful and they\\'re involved at UTARobberies happen at least once a semester. I personally think that\\'s good considering how big UTA is population wise.Aside from the robberies that happen after hours UTA is relatively safe. It\\'s not a party school so alcohol and drug abuse are not a big problem.I like how the classes aren\\'t too big and of course you had your really small classes. They have a variety of professors with a variety of teaching styles. However the math department sucks. They make it so much harder than it has to be. Also I\\'m not xenophobic but lecturers and lab TA\\'s should be able to speak proper English and honestly a lot of them don\\'t.In my experience, the people who do well at UTA do very well outside of it. The value of a degree from this school is directly proportionate to how hard you actually worked for it. That said, I feel the quality of the career center/ services is not good at all. I think they are failing in providing students useful career advice.I\\'ve had so many different types of professors and classes at UTA, and I learned something from all of them. Most of them are there because they truly want their students to learn.Campus crime definitely is real and not exactly rare, but I think UTA police does a good job of informing students of danger, as well as doing their best to prevent it.There are so many options, but I never lived on campus.I am not too knowledgeable about it. There is greek life and greek housing, but I was never interested in it.I would choose my school again because of the enriching life experiences I was able to take part in. I\\'ve learned a lot from interesting and diverse people that attend as students as well as faculty.I am not too involved or interested in athletics at school, but find student gym is a great facility.I live above campus security so I always feel safe. I love how you can call someone at night, and they can take you back to your dorm or car so you don\\'t have to walk alone late at night. I haven\\'t seen that at other schools and I\\'m really glad UTA decided to do something like that to protect the safety of their students.Classes are a lot harder here compared to the college I was attending in Houston; they require a lot more time and effort. The professors are fairly helpful, however just like any other college, you will run into a bad professor like I did win my technical writing professor, but just make sure to check Rate My Professor online and sign up early for classes and you should be okay.I am a nursing major, so this is a very excellent school for me to be at. UTA has the best nursing program in the state of Texas, and one of the best nursing graduate programs in the country. Getting a degree here will do amazing things for me and open so many doors and possibilities; I cannot wait to graduate with my BSN from the University of Texas at Arlington.I live in Vandergriff hall and it is the best! I love how clean it is, and the rooms are very nice!The Greek life here is pretty small compared to what I\\'ve seen at other universities, but I have met some great people in the Greek life and I am not apart of it.UTA doesn\\'t have a football team; I think that if they did, people would start attending more sporting events.My professors have, for the most part, been very helpful and I have learned a lot. I\\'ve met some great people here, and the on campus housing are nice and convienent for people like me who moved 300 miles away from home.Greek life is what keeps the school spirit lifted and just ensures an overall exciting atmosphere on campus.  They have a lot of events and cook-outs, which all students love.  Other students don\\'t view Greek students as bad, in fact, they love them for keeping campus life alive and fun! Here is a few Greek houses available on Greek row, but the majority of Greek students just live in dorms like the non-Greek students.  The Greek students here value academics and volunteering work.  Greek life is definitely not just for partying!Athletics are not a big thing at UTA.  We do not have a football team, but our basketball team is fairly good.  Our school spirit is not that great either.  That is one of the downsides of UTA.Campus life can be dead sometimes due to the big amount of students that commute, but apart from that, UTA is a great university.  Tons of opportunities are available to help you succeed academically and the professors are very passionate and helpful.  Once you join organizations and become more involved in the university, a great time is guaranteed!  UTA really wants you to succeed.There are always policemen on campus when I am around. But I do feel more safe in groups.I really have not been to one of these on campus, but I have heard they are helpful.My courses have been easy to manage. My professors are okay and explain what they are teaching about.Greek life is ok. It is most peoples thing and they join, you really do not have to be pressured into it.I enjoy being enrolled at this school. The courses are taught by fantastic professors with good option hours if you need help or advising. The class sizes are surprisingly not overwhelmingly huge and I feel that I can connect better with my professors and peers. There is also a diverse amount of classes to take especially for my major (Accounting). Overall, UTA has been a great experience so far.The school has fraternities and job fairs that help us network with future employers. There are many activies that take place on campus that would look great on a resumÃ©. Speaking of which, there are also seminars on how to write a proper resumÃ©! There is a lot of potential to get a great job, while still working on a degree.I feel safe here on campus, even at night because the campus provides a service with campus security that escort you to wherever you need to go if it gets too dark at night! Also there is a great mandatory course every student takes that informs of the risks and dangers of alcohol, drugs and bad relationships.They contribute to the school and the people who join them gain a lot of opportunities.Very easy to access, I felt like I was given all the information I needed.financial aid department is difficult to get in touch withThe area of Arlington surrounding UTA can be sketchy at times, but the on campus police always have a presence somewhere and do a good job preventing crime.I see career events going on monthly. If you want a job directly after graduation, then you will be able to find it.The courses really prepare you for your future and what you will need to know.I used to not live in a dorm on campus, but now that I do I am doing better in my classes and having more fun.Our teams can compete with the best universities in the nation, the only lacking part is school pride. Not that many people show up to games.I had the opportunity to go to The University of Texas at Austin but I forfeited it because this place is so great. The schooling and housing and overall everything is just cheaper. The people who go to school here are great as well.It\\'s something that is well appreciated on campus. Its relatively easy to form your own sports group and you get to meet many great people!Its a very diverse school. The people are nice and the faculty are very helpful. There are many resources available for students.It\\'s alright, typical safety school.In my experience the advisers are nigh useless.It\\'s a sketchy area, but the police are helpful.My ex boyfriend\\'s dorm was really nice!I don\\'t participate enough to commentAbout average for a college.very diverse, some (not all) professors are brilliant and talented, getting admitted was easy and took no effortProfessors are usually helpful during class making the time meeting with them outside of class minimal. They are always open to speak to their students.The value of education and a degree is very much valued. The school hold a job fair for all majors every semester giving great opportunities for internships and other occupations.Safety and security has never been an issue inside. There have been some robberies & assaults near parking lots in the evenings however.Greek life at school plays a good part in helping the community but don\\'t thing there is enough fraternities/sororities.UTA is a great school to experience education. It is very diverse which makes it a big feature of the school.Overall, athletics is pretty good. However; there is no football team so it can\\'t be considered a big sports school Basketball would probably be the most popular.Not a bad school, good prices, okay overallThere were multiple reports of robberyThere was not a huge focus on sports.UTA is a great university. I have found the staff and teachers very knowledgeable friendly and helpful. I would strongly recommend it to any student wishing to fulfill their dreams.There have been some assaults on campus in the past few years, but there are measures in place to fix them. One includes being walked to your car from the library if you feel unsafe.Nothing great about a UTA degree, but it is more valuable or just as valuable as most schools.Professors are good. Classes are decent. Overall pretty good.Average. Pretty nice, slightly costly for someNot a Greek school. Its a very small group of people.This is not a sports college. The basketball team is the best team on campus, nut even that isn\\'t talked about ever. If your looking for a football or sports school, look elsewhere.UT Arlington is a good school. It is not the most academically challenging college in Texas, but the rigor of the classes is a good amount. The one problem  have with the school is the lack of a campus life. UTA is a commuter school, and an international school. You do not get the same feel as a college town like where I transferred from. It feels like an extended high school with a little more freedom of what classes to take. If you do not care about the social part of college and having the college experience, ad only want to focus on school, then this is a good place for you. The clubs at UTA are great and that does help meet people.We have abundant security but only due to the abundant past activities that have happened hereThe classes are decent but the professors are hard to approach. Also, you have to study hard. The variety of classes are very limited and the class styles are very on your own approach.They have careers for certain majors only. This is a very specific major school. They only look out for some majorsIt\\'s big here but not too bigI\\'m a microbiology major and because of the extreme holds and circumstances, I couldn\\'t enroll in the biology course that I needed. The courses are very limited if you aren\\'t an engineering or nursing major. I have been here for almost two months and I still haven\\'t been able to find clubs or groups to join.Its a very safe and comfortable campus, accomodating people from multiple diverse communities.Highly valued. Lots of senior year employment prospectives aswell as summer internship opportunities.Professors are very approachable. The whole academic atmosphere is very encouraging and helpful. Very bright energetic minds here.Campus housing is comfortable for a college dorm life. Lots of options available here.I am not really a lot into the whole greek experience, so my review may be inadequate to what the true experience is about.The team spirit is high on campus like every other college. Though further construction is always fanciful.It\\'s a great place for thosw seeking a whole range lf diversity. The experience is kind of once in a lifetime. You develop and hone skills which will definitely enable your professional progress.people get mugged in the parking lot all the time and ive heard of quite a few girls being sexually assaulted at greek events. i dont feel the school does enough to prevent these things.most of my professors have done a very good job, just a few here and there were just awful. the class sizes were very nice, but most of the classrooms are very ugly.most of the pre-med and nursing students get accepted into med/ nursing school.i dont really like the idea of greek life. even though the frats and sororities are not suppose to haze, I know that they do. they also all just drink all the time and the older members supply alcohol to minors at all the parties.there arent many sports at this school so the athletic facilities dont really need to be amazing. there is a good workout center and a nice climbing wall though. i only wish they offered more classes for working out.the school is cool. its cheap and the campus is pretty. however, i wish they had more options for classes and more assistance with helping to pick classes.Theres been a range of crimes from sexual assault to robberies. The school does offer a service where if you call the school police and ask for a police escort, a policeman/woman will walk with you to your car in any case you do not feel safe, unfortunately this service isn\\'t promoted or used much. They have blue call phones at parking lots in case of an emergency. The problem is ANYONE can come on campus, its not gated or protected in that sense. In the majority of crimes- people that aren\\'t even students/attend UTA are the ones committing these crimesSome courses video taped so you can go back and view them online if you missed somethingIts basically paying to have friends, why join? just unnecessary groups to make more money out ofWe have no \"real\" football or soccer teams, they\\'re just intramural clubs.In my opinion the tuition + parking fees + book fees + lab fees are quite steep for an education. Its become a business instead of a means to help people gain a better education thus better life for themselves. Unless you live on campus in a dorm you have no idea what goes on- activity wise, its so HARD to get involved with things when you\\'re a commuter student. No rude or overly friendly people which is okay- they\\'re respectful no harassment. $500 to park in the on campus garage for ONE semester is RIDICULOUS!! it should be the price for a whole academic year. Some teachers really expect you to be experts at their subject, its kinda ludicrous because most students do take more than one course a semester and we do have to study for multiple things. I wouldn\\'t choose my school again if i could do it over. If i had to it would only be because it\\'s a relatively calm environment close to home.they attract a lot of studentsSchool is awesome, there\\'s a lot of support for students who need help. Many activities go on here and it\\'s just awesome.No one really goes to the games or talks about the sportsGood location, and professors are helpfulIt\\'s fun - Always cheering for the best!There are plenty of resourcesBeing in a decent-sized city exposes us to many different things, good and bad.Campus services on are great for safety for precautions.Feels like home away from home.Many successful people have come from UTA. The area we live in has many opportunities post-grad. The school does a great job preparing you for the \"real world\".I live in higher end campus apartments, so nothing to complain about. Some on campus housing is poor quality though. Pricing could be better suited for quality as well.Proud Brother of Omega Delta Phi. Best decision I\\'ve made since coming to college. Infinite resources and support. Widely misunderstood.Not enough school pride. Nice facilities. No football :(Diverse students. Great campus. Terrible parking arrangement.UTA Police work very hard to make sure that its a safe campus. They can be seen patrolling at all timesWhile UTA may not be the best known school right now, its starting to get some recognition. Degrees from UTA have value and companies in the area respect the school a lotI love UTA. It was my first choice school and I am so grateful to have been accepted. Its a good school for both commuters and those wanting to live on campus.I really enjoy living in the dorms. It may not be the newest but its a place for me to go at night and I really enjoy the people I live withIm not personally part of Greek Life but I do have several friends who are and they love it. Everyone is really friendly and they\\'re not at all offended if you\\'re not interested in joiningThe basketball teams here are amazing as well as othersI love UTA its so diverse and uniqueDuring the fall we had a bit of scares when it came to armed robberies. I felt as though the situations could\\'ve ben handled in a better way. The only time I feel uneasy is when I am walking to my car or around campus when it is dark. I prefer to walk with another person, it is scary to me to be alone.The career center is a great place to go when you need guidance to a new job. They help you in countless ways ranging from resume guidance to mock interviews. I feel like this program can and will help me obtain a job after graduation.I love UTA and I feel like I belong here. I love how amazing the student organizations have ben to me. My favorite part of campus is the Leadership Center. I enjoy being involved and I am glad I was given this amazing opportunity.I am a commuter student so I do not have much to say about campus housing.I am non-Greek, so I do not have much insight on the topic. There are some groups that appear to be intimidating, but overall our Greek life is pretty great.Though our team spirit isn\\'t as great as I wish it would be, we still love to support our varsity teams. I have attended some basketball games and for those who actually attend are having a great time.I enjoy how welcoming the campus is. All of the faculty is really good about making you feel important. I love the diversity my campus has. We have countless opportunities to meet and mingle with people from all over the world. The one thing I would have to complain about is the parking lots being further from campus. I, at times, feel unsafe when I have to walk to my car after dark. Though the campus does offer a police escort an a certain time, I still don\\'t feel to comfortable about being on campus when its dark out.I feel scared to walk around campus alone when there aren\\'t as many people around, and once the sun goes down I make sure I\\'m constantly aware of my surroundings. The parking lots are so far away from campus that anyone could easily get into trouble since there is no one else around. We\\'ve had multiple incidents of sexual assault, robberies at gunpoint, and actual shootings taking place near campus. I do not feel safe here at all.There are a lot of career day type events that go on on campus, but I\\'ve never personally talked to a recruiter or anything like that. I\\'ve heard that the career center is helpful when you\\'re having trouble finding jobs related to what you want to do, so I\\'m planning on visiting it soon.As an engineering majored student, this college relates to lots of other professors in different colleges. There will always be some different types of  forums around(related to engineering field). Good atmosphere to be involved studying and lots of events related to engineering field.So far it has been very great! Everyone Ive talked to about my transfer has been wonderful! Can not wait to begin classes online next month to earn a bachelors in nursing.I enjoy this university because not only are the people on campus friendly, but it is an active school and they push for all students to be involved in something. I love the positive energy I feel when walking through campus and seeing organizations interact with the students and fundraising for their causes or being informative. Another positive is that the school is affordable.I am an international student from other country. 2017 is my first time to come to America. I have to say there are many kind and helpful professors and stuff at UTA. The students are also very nice.The campus is beautiful, and the student body is very diverse. The athetlic aspect isn\\'t a huge deal, but that seems to be just fine for most students including myself. I\\'ve liked my professors and the course material so far.At UTA, academics always come first. Most professors will take the time to consult you one on one, even in the Nursing program in classes that are a 1:180 ratio. I love how challenging the classes are, it makes me feel well prepared to enter the job market. The campus is really diverse, with important aspects of life being celebrated and talked about openly. It\\'s nothing to see a well handled protest for rights, as well as people coming together to fundraise. Academic events as well as social events are well funded and thought out, and students are able to experience all walks of college life.From all the experiences I have had so far yet at UTA, I would highly recommend this college to anybody who is looking for a not so big but not so small college to fulfill their career paths and career goals. It is great for just about any field out there!I\\'ve had such a great experience and I enjoy the people there.  I\\'ve learned so much since I decided to move closer to the campus. It\\'s got a great culture and the student life is amazing. I think they could improve with the parking for students. I love the food and how there is always a Starbucks near by.I like the diversity of the school.  The different major they offer. The Advising system is great. There is always events going on at school. Free stuffWhen I visited UTA, I felt like I was at home with the school. The campus is beautiful and the classes are amazing. They have world-renoun programs and will go one-on-one with you about your plan. I didn\\'t have to choose which school I wanted to go to, it chose me.The service from the administration office is very lazy because any questions that were asked were either an automatic answer that either vaguely helped or was not in context of the question or it was a person that didn\\'t try very hard to help. One question was passed both and forth between emails and in the end it still wasn\\'t answered and eventually I gave up. However, during a college visit they were very helpful with answering any questions and supplied detailed explanations of the college background and included commonly asked questions and answers to help.The campus is beautiful and the students and staff there are so nice and will treat you like a family. The school itself is warm and inviting and since it is both twenty minutes away from Dallas and Forth Worth it is easy to get to the Texas hot spots!No one has ever had a bad experience, many schools take tours, it is very close to home, there\\'s different cultures, but what could change is the requirements to be accepted.I loved the diversity and I can\\'t wait to start taking classes and advance with my goals. Hopefully I will enter the nursing program and become an nurse after completing the program. The whole University looks amazing and all the activities and recreation places are impressive.I\\'m only a freshman and almost done with the first semester and I think UTA is an okay school. Most students here commute, so there is not much of a university life. Oh, and we don\\'t have a football team either. The only thing I really like about UTA is the diversity; you can literally walk on a street and hear 6 different languages spoken. I believe that UTA is like the 5th most diverse university nation wide.I would like to change the campus atmosphere, its very dull. The campus was decorated for homecoming and I believe we should have decorations up around campus year round.UT Arlington is a diverse university with people from all over the world, exposure to such various cultures helps create students who can thrive in our cosmopolitan world.I love the diversity of the college here. It is number five in the country in diversity among the students attending.My favorite part of UTA is the sense of community. Students can get involved with so many different clubs and school really focuses on preparing their students for the \"real world\".The classes there were of great quality, but I would love to see more improvements on offering scholarships or grants because I feel like it is hard for some students to find the right offerings for them. Also, the campus is kinda small, only offering a limited amount of housing, and some of them are even too costly, it would be great if there are more dorms available and cheaper for students to afford.The professors at this school are great, they love what they teach so it\\'s actually entertaining to listen to the lectures! The classes are huge, so that\\'s not the greatest thing, but the professors still care about every student. There are so many different courses offered here that I\\'m surprised at what some fellow students are taking!After staying in the dorms I felt like I had completely wasted all of the money I had spent. I had a bad experience with the cleanliness of my dorm (there was a ton of mold), plus the roommate matching didn\\'t go so well. There was lots of activities to do at the dorms though, like volleyball, videogame tournaments, etc.We don\\'t have much Greek life on our campus since we only have a few different sororities/fraternities. Personally, I see them as somewhat snobby and difficult to talk to. It\\'s also hard to get involved because of the cost, our Greek life isn\\'t even big and it still cost thousands to get involved in it!The biggest sport at my school is basketball, which seems to be pretty popular. We have a great team, so I think that\\'s why so many people enjoy attending the games. However, this is the only sport that anyone pays attention to. If we had a football team, I think people would get more involved in sports.Most of the professors at my school are incredibly talented in their fields, it\\'s amazing listening to them talk about something that they love. However, I think that the science programs could be better (specifically the labs). If I could do it all over, I would probably have gone with my first choice school, but UTA seemed like the more affordable option. At the time, this was the best choice for me.Haven\\'t had any terrible incidents besides a car being broken into once out the two years I have been there. I feel safe walking around campus at nightTeachers are open for office hours oftenTowards senior year is when networking is great for you and advisors are always there to help youVery calming and clean while walking to classNot sure what greek life isI have not seen to many issue in my time at UT Arlington.UT Arlington is a decent school. It\\'s a good commuter choice for those in the DFW area. Professors know what they\\'re talking about for the most part and campus life is slowly getting better as time goes on.A degree from UT Arlington will obviously depend on the major you decide to get, but overall it is a respected school.We only have a basketball team and a softball team, so not many go to the gamesI like the fact that I am at the point in my college career where I only have to take my intended major classes now.Dorms have a wide range. The cheaper dorms are definitely that, cheap. However Arlington, KC, and Vandergriff Hall are all extremely nice.Greek life is pretty low-key in Arlington. The majority of the kids here are commuters which hampers the ability of Greek life to shoot off.The gym is very new and nice to use. Only the basketball and volleyball teams are competitive and worthwhile watching.Diverse commuter school with decent campus life. Not top tier, but not terrible.They are extremely helpful and want you to succeedThe career center gives student a lot of options and help to get student organized for future careersThe school is located in a not so great part of town.The local area is not very safeGreek Life is pretty neutralOther than the turner over of academic advisers, the school experience has been great.There is a lot of dorms and apartments to choose form. The rent is not too bad, but there is a big sense of community within the dorms.Although there is not a lot of Greek houses on campus there is still a huge community for any and all interested in joining Greek life.The MAC (Maverick Activity Center) is a giant two story complex that houses multiple basketball courts, rock climbing room, indoor soccer room, and tons of weight lifting and exercise equipment for students to remain active and healthy.To start off my school is pretty huge. This means that there is tons of opportunities for all types of people. There\\'s a wide range of clubs and events for students to get involved in whether it is extracurricular or academic, and the school does a lot to put the different clubs and events out there such as activity fairs and an entire website dedicated to showing what all organizations the school has to offer.I feel very safe here, so much so even at nightEvery professor is unique and I am the person I am today because of who they were.There are opportunities to succeed, we just need to know where to look for themI love Trinity Hall! I am definitely considering living in the same room that I am living in nowI\\'m not to sure EXACTLY what it is that they do, but I haven\\'t heard any stories of vandalism or rape or murder. So they are the best :-)I LOVE THE ATHLETICS FACILITY. I am at the gym at least three times a week, it is a great way to end the day with a quick run on the track or a couple of reps the bench press.I love the opportunity that I was given to such an awesome and amazing campus. EVERYDAY I learn something new, and I am not just talking about in the classroom, no. I am talking about the groups here on campus. This university is known for its diversity, but I say, there is more to diversity than how someone looks, and I have got to say, the diversity of ideas definitely spans the spectrum of ideologies. From Christians and Atheists to Nurses and Engineers. This campus has alot to offer, you just need to know where to look and where to go.It all depends on what fraternity or sorority you jump into. Some focus too much on partying, while others focus heavily on the culture and morals of their fraternity as a whole.I haven\\'t had any issues with the University. The people here are kind, unique, and have generally varying background that make the entire experience exciting.I generally feel pretty safe on campus and I haven\\'t had a problem yet.From what I\\'ve experienced, it\\'s all pretty good.  Nothing much to complain about.Personally, I\\'ve found the school to be very likable.Not a big athletic college.i feel very safe on campusthe professors are really helpful and nicethere are a lot of opportunities on campus and ways to get internships through UTAi don\\'t live in uta housing but ive heard it is greatit is a great way to meet peoplethe athletics are very fun to watch and attendit is a great schoolclinic on campus is free and available to everyonei am a member of greek life and i love itTa\\'s are not helpful at allwalking from class to class, i always see some frat or sorority stand around, trying to sell baked - or barbequed - goods or raising awareness for some kind of cause. Greek life at UTA is nice because they provide goods/services and they don\\'t get in your face about it so if you don\\'t want to participate in it, you can just avoid itI live off-campus, around 30 minutes from the school, so I don\\'t really participate in the athletics part of the school; however, it is easy to see how big sports are around campus - I\\'m constantly getting emails about new games, etc and there always seems to be something going on with some sport that is advertised everywhere. For those more sports-inclined, it is not at all difficult to find something to cheer forAlthough smaller than most schools, it\\'s growing.It\\'s smaller than most colleges, but looks positiveBasketball is the big sport here, and they\\'re goodAll has been great, but some registration was hardathletic events aren\\'t really attended only homecoming, no footballIt\\'s a beautiful campus, with many opportunities.There is always something happening as far as safety is concerned. There are constant robberies going on especially in parking lots.On campus jobs are easy to find. Internships are harder to get. I have not yet used the career center so i am not aware of how helpful it is.So far, I find the school to be very diverse and accepting of all kinds of people. The courses offered are the only thing i have trouble with. For my major, there aren\\'t enough classes being offered each semester. I am happy with the class sizes its always been very easy to communicate with and understand the professors.I have personally no experience with campus housing but i do have friends who live on campus. I have heard from them how small rooms can be.I have personally never been involved but i always see the different events they have going on around campus and it seems very welcoming and fun.I have personally never been involved in any kind of athletic activity on campus.My experience with UTA has been okay. Managing classes, the homework load, help from professors and other resources its all been nice. The only thing i have had trouble with every semester is dealing with finding the classes i need.the overall experience is alright. I expected more from this school. the tuition fees are a lot for international students which is a bit of a problem however, the administration is good.There are no sports that I attend, mostly because of market. I never know about them and when I find out about them, the reviews aren\\'t always the best. Also, I believe because of it, there is real no school spirit.The people are great. The professors are great for the most part. The school is okay. However, I do not see myself growing in this department. It is a safety school for me, because it is affordable and close to home.I\\'ve had good experiences with most of the professors I\\'ve had. The ones I didn\\'t was mainly because they were disorganized.The main professors in my program were formerly professionals in the field and have invaluable resources available.The Nursing major at UTA is one of the highlights of UTA. UTA Nursing is ranked number one in Texas.I feel safe at school, but not around the apartment around the school.With the major I\\'m going with (Nursing), it is most likely that one will guaranteed a job when one graduates from UTA.UTA has a lot of people in one some classes, which can degrade the level of learning environment but the labs in UTA are great!UTA has a lot of international students; therefore, it is a very diverse school with great Nursing program. The overall people, like students and staff and professors, are nice and easy to get along with.Overall, security is great on campus. There are call poles everywhere, and the walkways are brightly lit at night.I highly enjoyed working with my professors throughout the semester. They are there for you and will help you succeed as long as you show you want to excel. Get in a FIG if you can. The study groups are really nice.If you want to get in to Brazos, you have to apply in the fall of the previous year. i.e, Fall 2015 if you\\'re an incoming freshman for Fall 2016Safety isnt an issue for most people anymoreClasses can be tough, but thats collegeIf you\\'re a dedicated student who wants to go into Nursing, who loves a diverse atmospehere, and who loves to be academically challenged, then UTA is right for you. I was pleasantly surprised to see how the campus cared and wants you to succeed. rnrnIf there was one thing I could change about UTA - it would be parking. I was almost late for a test (I got there an hour early + some) because all of the garages were full. Be prepared for some tough parking if you\\'re a commuter.Room was fine, but roommate suckedI like our greek life. Its getting bigger too!Our baseball and Basketball teams are really goodI like UT Arlington a lot it\\'s a great schoolThe dorms are good on campus, the meal plan required is rather dissatisfying though.If you are under 21 it is hard to get stuff to do legally.The parties are thrown by Greeks & they have ridiculous requirements to enter.Athletic teams are good, but they have little support.Typical greek life; it requires a financial payment.The study lounges in the dorms are a positive step.There are constantly multiple police patrols out at the same time.Considering the vast amount of students that attend, it is still possible to proceed down your path.There should be more jobs on campus open to students.It\\'s very diverse and helps you appreciate every cultureSo hard to get into and unfairVery open and friendly enviornmentRight now it seems like there are more students than there is class space. Many classes fill up quickly without the addition of more options. You have to be diligent to register early.I don\\'t know that any campus feels completely safe nowadays. Being a male, a sexual assault is not a concern to me, but violent attacks on campus are. I am looking forward to the campus-carry law that is taking effect this next year. I think that law will help deter attacks from happening on campuses in Texas.I have absolutely no desire to join a fraternity. I feel like \"Greek life\" on campus is somewhat out-of-control. They pollute the campus with noise and obstructions.So far I am satisfied with my choice in schools. The most difficult process has been getting registered for classes. The process is overly complicated and repetitive, and it often feels like no one knows who I should talk to. Last semester I was sent in a circle of four or five people multiple times before I was finally able to figure out who I was supposed to communicate with. rnrnSome of the professors seem to care about the material that they are teaching, and they enjoy working with students, but I often feel like teaching is is the last thing on their mind and classroom prep suffers.I am not concerned about athletic programs that a campus provides. I am glad that I attend a school without a football program! The workout facility is very nice, and I am happy that I have access to it.Very fun time learning at UTA! Had great professors and lots of interning classes hat have taught me a lot.Security is definitely pretty tight around the campus, but I do feel a lot more safe there.They were very personal when teaching and gave students lots of room to ask questions and understand the topic.This school has a great kinesiology program which is what I am going into. I think graduating from this big of a school will already be plenty good enough for many jobs I will find.They have some very nice apartments on campus!They volunteer a lot, it\\'s fun !I play softball there and I love it!I used things I learned in the classroom in everyday life!There have been a number of security issues in only one semester and it makes me feel uneasy. I want to walk around feeling safe.I do not like it or the options or the proximity. But I understand, you get what you can affordI am not in any Greek society because I personally do not think I have time for that and it is not something I will be interested in. But they seem to have fun and enjoy themselves. Would recommend to someone who is all about thatIt is just fine. I do not think I need anything more. The MAC is greatI do like it at UTA. There are definitely some improvements that can be made especially with the Residence halls and Apartments. But all in all, love it here.I love the structure of the online courses. They are centered around what you should learnI have loved all of the professors I have hadI think I will have many opportunities upon graduationI love it. I was originally at a community college in Austin. I feel like I am going  somewhere with UTA. And all of the professors are incredibly helpful as well as the staff. I had an opportunity to attend University of Texas at Austin and still chose ArlingtonCampus hosuing gets the students a chance to know each other.The athletics show our school spirit.Greek life gives off an enthusiastic vibe.I feel pretty safe on campus.Within the first couple of months, there have been three gun related incidences. Two of them armed robberies in the campus parking lot and another where a non-student had on gun on campus (only down the hall from where I was). There has also been a sexual assault right outside of campus with a student as a victim. Earlier this month campus police and Arlington Police Department blocked the Architecture Building because of a possible suspect with a large gun, however it was only a tripod. During that incident, I feel the police should have closed off the outside of the architecture building more because this suspect could have had a rifle. rnrnOverall the police do what they can.The courses are very straight forward.Of course it all depends on your major, but as a math major it is very difficult to get a supportive math professor. Some professors are really good but most are foreign so it is really hard to understand them when it comes to teaching a topic. As far as the topics go, they are tedious and down to detail so know your background knowledge and be prepared to always practice and have a ton of course work.Because UTA is a very diverse school, the best way to create your career outside of getting the degree is networking with people. Really get to know your professors that you believe will help you in your future. The career center is the best place to go when it comes to finding the perfect job for on campus or after you graduate. They are very helpful and guide you through the process of having a successful career.UTA is in the process of bringing back a vibrant greek lifestyle. Most greeks are very helpful to the school and to the community and with UTA being a very diverse campus there\\'s a sorority or fraternity for everyone.Since UTA almost every sport except football, most of the students concentrate more on their studies and/or participate in intramural sports. Because of the lack of athletics and the number of commute students there\\'s not a lot of school spirit to support most sports.if you are a commute student, this is school is the perfect safety school, however make sure you get a good parking spot. Also if you are a transfer student, this may not be the school for you because of the barely any to none scholarships they offer transfer students and since most of these classes are hard, don\\'t count on your transfer GPA to help you.I love living on campus and I glad I choose to or I\\'d be driving in Arlington traffic every day. The residence hall I live in is the best because it\\'s like living in my own little apartment just without the kitchen area. I live in a suite with 2 other roommates and we share a bathroom and living area. I like that we have mutiple lounge areas to study or socialize in. I dislike that on my floor  (1st floor) particularly that we only have 2 washing machines available and sometimes only 1 because people do not know how to wash their laundry even with signs above them telling people how to. My residence hall is the closest to the student center which holds almost everything including the post office, the cafe, places to study, and a convient store. The price was a little bit much because living there requires that you have a meal plan but it\\'s worth it and the housing process was super easy.Greek Life at UTA is very involved with our community and they love to give back whether its to the actual Arlington community or a charity. The Greeks are very nice and do not exclude anyone because they are non-greeks. The only Greek housing available is of course only for the IFC/PHC and not other Greeks like NPHC (national pan-hellenic council) or MGC (multicultural greek council.)I personally am not interested in any of the sports that play during the fall besides football and because we do not have a football team I have to motivate myself to go watch our basketball team. Our men\\'s basketball team this fall has been \"killing it.\" I think they are one of the best in our league right now from what I see at the games I\\'ve been to. We have a lot of school spirit and mostly all of campus comes to support especially when they give out free goodies like t-shirts. I can\\'t wait until this upcoming spring semester because I am a fan of baseball/softball.I finished my first semester at UTA and honestly my time here as changed my perspective about the school. I thought this school was just going to be like high school and that I wouldn\\'t be able to get the \"college experience\" because it is so close to home but it feels like a whole new world. UTA is so diverse from professors to students and they are all friendly and we come together as a community to help eachother. One of my favorite experiences so far, kind of bad thinking back on it, but there was a stick up in one of our student parking lots (Lot 50) and there was a student that made \"Straight outta lot 50\" shirts with \"Stay Viligant\" on the back and every shirt bought the proceeds went to a charity. I thought that was really cool because it brought awareness about campus safety and it helped others in need. If I could do it all over again I would still pick UTA as my final choice. Whenever old high school friends that are graduating in 2016 ask if they should apply for UTA I tell them absolutely!I am in KC Hall and it is great! It\\'s very clean and spacious and the RAs are nice.  It\\'s on campus so it is a lot faster to get to classes without having to wake up really early and fighting for parking.This school doesn\\'t have a football team so there\\'s not one sport that the whole student body roots for.  There is basketball and volleyball but it isn\\'t the same.  The school spirit is very low and the games don\\'t have a huge turnout.  The facilities are very nice though.Overall it is an okay school. The one thing that I really don\\'t like about it is that there is not any unifying school spirit.  Everyone wears different school shirts and most people are commuters so the campus doesn\\'t have any nightlife.I feel pretty safe, at night I stay in a group or talk on the phone to make sure if something happens someone knows. But nothing has ever happened to me.Most of my professors were great, but I had one teacher that graded weird which kind of effected my grade when I should\\'ve done betterIt\\'s great!! I have learned so much and met alumni!Sometimes it\\'s great food, other times it\\'s alright but not uneatableI didn\\'t join a sorority but my roommate did and she loves it.I don\\'t go to games but i hear about them and people love going to games.We were robbed in the same parking lot twice in the same week.My professors are great instructors whom I feel truly care that I learn their language and involve myself in their clubs.The career center will help you if you need it, but you have to put forth the effort to find them.I\\'m attempting to live on Campus. It\\'s very expensive but hopefully will be worth it.I don\\'t deal much with Greek life so I can tour an opinion.I don\\'t really attend the events on campus for sports and they are moderately advertised.I love going to UTA , there\\'s tons to do regarding extracurricular a AND academics. I just wish that their Russian Program had more professors rather than two with only one teaching the language.UTA is a great school where I have met many new people and have succeeded in my first semester!Academics are great. I really enjoy my classes and the professors. The nursing program is very competitive and rigorous, but I believe well worth the time and effort.The University sends out an alert through a text or email if something is going on on-campus. The shorthorn also informs students of the current happenings on-campus.I\\'m sure it\\'s great, I don\\'t know very much about the student career prospects or the value of a degrees from this school yet.Overall my experience for only a semester at the university is good. I like a lot of what they have to offer academically, I just wish that it wasn\\'t such a big commuter school.My experience with campus housing had been fine.  In August when I first moved in the dorm was filthy, I had to clean just about everything in the dorm. I also don\\'t like how far the parking lot is to my dorm. It\\'s a pain in the butt to bring groceries or my overnight bag to and from my dorm room.I am a new member of the sorority Alpha Chi Omega. I really enjoy it, I have met some great people. I don\\'t know what non-Greeks think about Greeks. Some members of the sorority or fraternity do live in their house, I don\\'t know specifically how many it is for each.I have yet to attend an athletic event, but I have heard great things about our basketball and volleyball teams.So far my overall experience has been alright. As a nursing major at UTA my program is very academically competitive. I enjoy my classes and the professors for the most part. However, the majority of UTA is made up of commuters which makes meeting people you can hang out with outside of class very difficult. Even many students who live on-campus go home on the weekends. As a student who\\'s home is four hours away from UTA I don\\'t have the convenience of going home as often as everyone else, therefore I typically feel alone on-campus on weekends.Nursing attracts large number of students because of its credibility.Frequent workshops, and recruiting events on campus.Some of the classes I attended were huge (200+ students); professor- student ratio is relatively high.Few incidents on parking lot have created fear on students to walk alone in some areas. School police provides 24 hour escort service if asked.Located close to classes, library, restaurants, and activity centers.Various activities of Greek organizations don\\'t let school be boring or lonely.High diversity of students, affordable, and good study environment. Multiple organizations for assisting veterans. I wouldn\\'t trust administration , and advising fully though.Does not have Football! Men\\'s basketball attracts a large crowd. Great activity center, and other facilities.Many crimes happen in the parking lots of campusThey make you look at your futureProfessors are very helpful if you are willing to askNo football team but great men\\'s basketball teamUT Arlington ranks top 5 in diversity among the USI tend to get text messages and emails when something happens on campus regarding our safety. I really appreciate them sending out the message to everyone so that we can be aware of what has taken place on our campus. I feel very comfortable walking by myself on campus no one has ever made me feel uncomfortable at anytime while here at UT Arlington.I feel like the student body really wants to achieve the getting their degree from UTA. I myself can not wait to receive my degree from UT Arlington. Although I haven\\'t seen that many employers on campus I feel like if I reach out more to different organizations here on campus they will be able to help me find the field of work  I\\'ve always wanted to work in.The very first class I took at Ut Arlington was Personality Psychology. It was an extremely big class ,coming for a community college, however, the professor managed to keep us engaged with his lectures and jokes.Greek life at my school is not really promoted that much, however we do have some Greek organizations that people can join in. When school first started they had all of there signs up trying to recruit the student body to join their organization. I don\\'t think the Greek students are looked down upon. The Greek students that I\\'ve meet have all been very nice and helpful.Whenever a games coming up I always get a super pumped up exciting flyer and or email. The student body is always excited and ready to cheer on our team. I love the fact that everyone has faith in our teams and is always rooting for them. Just the excitement and school spirit it\\'s self makes you want to attend a game to support the Mavs.I love UT Arlington, because everyone is so friendly! I love going to study in the library it\\'s one of my favorite locations on campus. I would definently pick this school again if given the chance because I absolutely love the school!Greek is the beginning the school behavior to success.I do involve in this problem. I hope to be minimize as much as you can.The night transportation are great. They can go any place when they wanted.The party often happen in the weekend. Everyone mostly participate in the party.They always has once a year lecture about sexual orientation.They have mostly every subject you want to learn.The class size is great. It is about thirty student in one class. So the students can communicate the professors easily.The campus network is accessible the student. The internet speed is normal to do homework.The campus crime same like does not in the campus.Living in a dorm is expensive but you have more time to study and focus on the school work.I like being in the urban because you could easily get the thing you wanted. Also students are nice and professors are incredible. They inspired me to be a better person every day.My school basketball team has a great team work. Almost a half of the court come to watch every game.There has been quite a bit of crime on campus, but I still do not feel particular unsafe.I know that graduating with a BSN from UTA will ensure with me with a job right off the bat.So far at UTA, I have had a good experience. The class sizes are good, the professors are helpful, the curriculum is pretty good, and the students are all pretty friendly.I do not live on-campus.Again, I do not know much about Greek life.I do not get very involved in the athletics life of the university, so I do not really know too much about it.So far, I have found that most professors at UT Arlington are always ready to help and want their students to succeed.The college that I chose is a good choice for me because it is close to home and is easily accessible. The professors are great and they really do care about the experiences of the students and make sure that they understand what is happening in each course and make sure that the students are having a good experience.I love everything about the university it makes me feel at home. UTA is a great school to attend. The class are great and the people on are campus are awesome. Arlington is a great community to be inInitially wouldn\\'t accept my transfer credits so I had to retake a lot of classes wasting time and money to get where I am now, but it was worth it.UTA has been a fabulous school to obtain my graduate degree.  The program is entirely online.  the professors are incredibly helpful and knowledgeable.UTA is one of the most diverse universities around.  I am currently a grad student and love my colleagues, my professors and the newer downtown campus available for business students.   I did attend for a large portion of my undergraduate classes as well and had nothing but success.  The campus life is amazing.  If you have an opportunity to live on campus, it is definitely a oncfe in a lifetime experience.My school visit to the university of Texas at Arlington was absolutely amazing . This school had met all of my requirements for my dream university. The campus wasn\\'t too shocking big and it was very diverse , the class rooms were pretty big though , but on the other hand , the school had so many student founded organizations and clubs . UTA is an incredible institution with nice staff members and great food options .The campus is a great medium sized campus. Not too big, not too small. They have a great Architecture program. The campus is also growing and they are adding some new on campus features like a dining hall and residence halls.One of the main things I enjoy about UTA is that it is extremely diverse. With coming to this campus I have met plenty of people from all parts of the world.I love how diverse the university is. There are many associations on campus to get involved in. It is a friendly environment.Overall I would say this is a perfect school if you are a transfer student. This school brings forth a lot of opportunity and diversity. If someone was looking for a way to be involved in the community and a school that is all about their students I would say this school is for them. Now, along with the pros I do have to mention some cons. The downside to this university is how expensive it is, for 23,000 a year, there is no teacher\\'s aid to assist when professors are not available, it cost to do everything on campus including printing, there is always a line to enter the library, and due to construction parking is very limited. I attended another university before coming to this one and their tuition was 10,000 less and I never had an issue with any of the above.I do like it here. The campus is quite beautiful for Texas. I\\'ve had almost completely positive experiences with professors. The only negative experiences I\\'ve had is with professors of 3000\\'s level classes.As being a college freshman student in the University of Texas at Arlington, I have learned a lot. Each of my professors are really nice and are determined to help me. What I like about this university is that is a very outgoing university. There is a lot of opportunities to succeed in the path of my future career of becoming a nurse. I also like that I feel safe when being on campus. The UTA police do take their job serious and make sure everyone feels and be safe. What I would like to see a change on is a decrease in the number of students on classes 250+. There should be several classes so students don\\'t have to attend a class of 250+ students. It\\'s really hard for students who have to sit on the back pay attention to the lecture and be able to see. I always need to be 30 minutes early in order to find a seat on the front to be focus in the lecture. Other than that, the University of Texas at Arlington is the great fit to continue my education.The school is good however I feel that the campus is kind of ugly. I also hate the fact that we don\\'t have a football team even though we  are a D1 school.What I liked about this college is that it had different facilities that were easily located and were not very hard to find. the people are great at this university and very friendly, I can easily take the bus from my home to the university and visit at any time.I liked all the student body as a whole, and they helped me make my choice of attending their next fall more easierThis was one of the top schools on my list of dream colleges.  The campus is very nice and filled with helpful staff. All my professors so far have been great!Im not in UTA but i plan on going there around fall of 2018 i have been there a couple of times and have a couple of friends that go there.I enjoyed the student environment at UT Arlington because there are endless opportunities to get involved on campus. I especially enjoyed participating in the Baptist Student Ministry on campus. The staff at UT Arlington desire success for their students and were extremely helpful with any question I ever had. There are study session for almost every class I took, which saved my grade several times in a couple of classes. The campus is also clean and safe, which is important to me in a place where I spend much of my time. nUT Arlington is the fifth most diverse university in the country! Experiencing so many cultures was an incredible experience which I am strongly grateful for.While completing my application for graduate school, hurricane Harvey hit the Texas coast.  It was challenging getting all the necessary documentation to them by the deadline. Their admissions department was phenomenal in emailing updates to me and taking the special circumstances into consideration. Very professional and courteous.I\\'m a freshman and so far the school is really good. I\\'ve already made friends and my professors take the right amount of time to cover the material we go over. There are many groups and clubs that I would consider joining. Also the campus is beautiful and has many spots for studying.I like the campus size and although it is a big school it was easy to find my way around the campus.UTA is a great school, I would start over and attend more activities so that i could be more involved and enjoy the college life. My favorite thing is working out at the campus gym with my friends.Overall, I love the college that I\\'m going too.For the most part the college has been very easy to navigate thru. Many of the courses and assignments are doable, and are able to get goo grades on, but if you get an Academic Coach who is unfair, and will not be objective to what is needed, then you are screwed. You can find yourself waiting days to hear about what is needed in an assignment with only 1 day to complete an assignment that can be labor intensive.UTA is an awesome school. they encourage diversity and their professors are the best.I love UTA because it is so diverse and the faculty and staff are helpful.It\\'s the only school in the area with a Spanish translation and interpreting program.As my goal was to achieve a BA in linguistics, my options were somewhat limited. However, if I had known how many opportunities and field experiences I would have, I would have gone to UTA sooner. The involvement of the professors in the success of their students in the linguistics department is nothing short of amazing.The campus is very open and great for walking. I wish there were more dining options near campus.I am loving the college experience at UTA! The advisors and professors are very helpful in making all students here successful. I enjoy that my advisor emails me often about upcoming events, community service opportunities, and job opportunities. I would choose the University of Texas in Arlington again over and over.I have been to the campus a couple of times to talk to counselors and finicial aid avdvisors. This campus is very open and has a great outdoor feel. I attend school completely online currently but the teachers I have had so far online are amazing and very hands on still with the questions I ever have.Very fun school with many diversities and culturesIf you are involved on campus you know more people and are more likely to get out of your shell.I love UTA. I\\'ve grown so much as a person and leader by attending this school. I\\'ve had several wonderful opportunities to see the world from a different perspective and I find that amazing.I really like the University of Texas at Arlington.  However, my favorite professor recently passed away.  I miss him.My school doesn\\'t do as many activities as I was  expecting. But other than that the school is okayUT Arlington has one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen. And the weather. Amazing. The campus itself is so relaxed and houses some of the nicest and diverse group of human beings I have encountered. The school itself admits it - they take pride in how diverse they are - from having a club for just about everything to celebrating ethnic and cultural days of importance and having festivals celebrating their cultural diversity. The teachers and staff are all nice and willing to help you with anything. The only thing that could be better was the financial aid department. Especially when applying as a CAP student. Overall the experience has been very amazing but be very affirmative when dealing with financial aid because they tend to push you aside a lot.Calculus one was very enjoyable.At the University of Texas at Arlington, the School of Social Work program is amazing! I\\'ve grab so much more in just one year of grad school than in my entire year of undergrad at a different school. I\\'ve really connected with my teachers and classmates. My classmate are actually turning into close friends.I really don\\'t have anything to compare it to other than community college. I went to a community college where the online component was better (both in terms of technology and offerings) but it can\\'t compare with the number and depth of courses offered at the university.The school I am currently attending is ok but I wish I went to the school where all my highschool friends are atI enjoy this school because they provide an awesome online program.While I\\'m having some major complaints about some professors and their inability to teach, the school is okay. Its difficult to get your adviser to help at first, and you pay a huge amount of money for a class with barely any material sometimes.I love my school and my campus! It\\'s not too big nor is it too small. It\\'s perfectly fit for me!Its ok my teachers are nice and we do meaningful things. We are learning our basics. Met a few new people this year only one freshman.The campus and the people are great. You get the university experience without having to move from home.Nice school. Great for Engineering.It was very difficult to get into the class of my choice due to late registration.The registration process has be tough but it\\'s mainly due to my ignorance on the stepsMy experienced was very good.I went with some of my school mates.I like the diversity and the many opportunities to learn about what the school has to offer and the help that\\'s always available.I love the university spirit and how the campus has an enormous amount of support available to the students.It has been a good experience so far.So far, the school, students, teachers, and campus look amazing and I feel like this will help my career.I love UTA. The campus is beautiful, the teachers are wonderful, and the student body is very diverse and accepting. The Mavs 1000 class that freshman are required to take has potential, but was not helpful at all when I had to take it.I am very excited to attend the University of Texas at Arlington because it is close to home and is exactly what I am looking for. I would chose this school over any other school.My overall experience at school was when I became a class officer for my sophomore year because it was fun and I got to become a leader. Having AVID here helping students with getting ready for college is what makes my school unique. Why I would choose my school all over again if I could is because it is such a great campus for any student, the teachers here are really great teachers, and the AVID program is an awesome program for college ready students.I chose my school because it was more affordable than most.I am excited for campus life! The freshmen orientation gave good information about college and what to expect. They give good scholarships, and have a friendly environment.The school I am currently attending is pretty good. The professors are great.UT Arlington is the best because of the amazing amount of diversity, first and foremost. It is the fifth most diverse university in the entire nation, and that really makes me feel at ease being an Asian student. The amount of school pride here is just overwhelming. Everything is about \"blue and orange\" and you\\'ll always be told to \"Mav Up\" anywhere you go. People come here for the prestigious nursing or engineering programs, but I just love feeling like at my home away from home.Teachers are okay but the advisors suck.I enjoy my school cause it\\'s got a nice campus and the area around it is full of places to go and stuff to do. I chose it mainly because of location. It\\'s about an hour from home so it\\'s not too close.I would probably love the school a lot more if there was more school spirit around campus throughout the entire year.University of Texas at Arlington as exposed me to much more better community around the campus area.rnrnIt is very interesting to learn in the same environment with different kind of culture, race and background.rnrnI plan to go for my grad school here at UTA again because of the love I have derived in the DFW area.The professors and more importantly the advising staff are there to help you.UTA is a very diverse university.  You will undoubtably be able to find people like yourself as well as be able to come into contact with many new cultures.It\\'s an amazing school. The teachers want to help you succeed and student tend to help each other out. The advisor\\'s are great they make knowing what\\'s next very ready and explain everything very carefully so you can understand what you have to do.I love everything about the school it is fun and an inexpensive aim at university knowledge.I love me school!!! I originally was attending an other university but it just was not a right fit for me. I feel more at home at my university compare to anywhere else.There\\'s a lot i like about the school; the people, the facilities, intramurals, etc. The only thing i dont like about the school is that there isnt a football team and that its predominatly a commuter school.Grading policy is not based on traditional numbers (A=92-100)University of Texas At Arlington (UTA) overall look pretty good. I  think I\\'m going to like it here.UTA is an excellent school. Everyone I have come into contact with here has been friendly and helpful. As a returning student, I have appreciated the positive experience.University of Texas at Arlington is a large campus with an small campus atmosphere which makes it easy to adjust into the college lifestyle.I really like UTA as a school. There are so many ways a student can receive help with academics, and it is also as affordable as college can be. However, the school seems a bit out-dated and its not so much of a lively campus as other division one schools are.The English department is fairly small and everyone forms a community of openness and discussion. The university has made a large effort to create an even bigger community and has been successful.overall i\\'m happy with the decisions i\\'ve made so far. i went to a community college and got my associates degree then transferred to a university. my only regret was that i should\\'ve paid attention to the school i was going to transfer to and see what courses were required.When I need help, I know it is always availible. If I need help with math, then I go to the math LAb. If I need help with a writing assignment, then I go to to writing center. The campus is large, always feels alive.I love UTA. It\\'s close to home, it\\'s \"affordable\" (as affordable as a 4-year school can get), the faculty and staff care, it\\'s easy to get involved.I have lived on campus for the past two years, but I do have friends that live off-campus and for the most part they enjoy the cheaper cost of their apartments, the only problem is having to drive to campus and find parking.I don\\'t really attend parties other than those hosted by the actual university, the annual Block Party is a great campus event.I like to got to Fuzzy\\'s Tacos which provide a convenient close location for Tex-Mex food. The Flying Fish provides healthy sea food options and has student discounts. Potagers is also a good restaurant that is healthy and organic.The campus staff works a lot in keeping the students updated in any danger situations, and cares about bettering their security system.People do complain about the Connection Cafe, but it has good food options if you explore the available lines instead of just opting for the safety of burgers all the time. Pie Five and CoolBerry Frozen Yogurt are the better campus restaurants to go and spend your College Park dollars at. The Pod can be overpriced, but it\\'s good for emergencies when you can\\'t go to an actual store.My two years at UTA have been covered by the combined total of scholarships and financial aid. The university scholarship information is provided to anyone online and most scholarship applications are pretty easy to complete.Vandergriff Hall is close to classes, the cafeteria, and campus restaurants. It provides a safety feeling with the enforcement of having to slide your ID to enter the building and your dorm.Lot\\'s of options, most of it is cheap enough for people like me to eat near the school everyday instead of waiting until you get homeThere\\'s nothing particularly detrimental, nor is there anything particularly supplemental for the student in the school policies. You just follow them. If you don\\'t follow them you risk consequences. Simple as thatI just got the Outstanding Freshman Scholarship for my school and that\\'s basically the only reason I\\'m able to attend. I\\'m not sure how to apply for scholarships.I don\\'t really know to much about off-Campus housing but I\\'m sure its just as good as on campus.Haven\\'t went to any parties yet but I hear they are fun.There are tons of food places all around the school you cant get there without passing one up.They very clear on what the policies are.I\\'ve never eaten it but all I hear is good things.It took a little while to receive but I got it no problemI have not had very good interactions with the administration. They are not very reachable, and they make you pay basically to walk from your car to class.I have only eaten on campus a few times with friends. The food is alright, nothing special. Each time I just opted for a salad.i don\\'t eat on campusthe process went well but this year that i want to re-applied they did not inform me that i need 24 hours  so its becoming a nightmareI do not care much for the Greek life, but mainly because I did not want to be apart of it. Most people do not like the Greek students or just do not really care for, but everyone has their own opinion. It all depends on the Greek affiliation. Some are really chill and cool with good goals, others not so much.Very good programs for sexual assault prevention, drug and alcohol abuse, emergency preparedness, safe sex, and much more. There are a few crimes on campus, but that will happen in nearly any college. Police are nice and will assist when asked. I feel perfectly safe on campus at all times.The activities center and the intramural fields are very nice. The other athletic facilities are also nice for the varsity students. Our big team here is basketball, although most students do not care or would prefer football instead. Yet there are faithful students who would faithfully attend the events, and the all-sports pass is very cheap, only $25 for access to all events year-long.Plenty of places around Arlington for variety of food in a good range of prices. My personal favorite is Bethany\\'s 2 minutes from campus (by car).As long as you follow the honor code, do not cheat, and obey campus rules, everything will be fine.They are quick to answer my questions. They are much better to deal with in person or over the phone.The dorms on campus allow you to get more involved with the activities on campus, as well as having their own. There are plenty of perks of living in dorms, such as a kitchen, cable, and study lounges.It an ongoing process lengthy. they had an error with finding my parents tax transcript which caused more time but they resolved it after I called fafsaThe gyms are ok but comparing to some of the bigger schools not so goodThere are tons of Apts and homes for you to move in to at any point of the yearIf you are looking for a party its easy to find one. People are friendly, drunk and high and will share everything with you not even knowing you.There are a number of places you can walk to and enjoy a good quality meal or McDonaldsThey aren\\'t horrible but not great. The follow the rules but do let some things slide. Those things will be easy to pick up on.I have the UTA scholarship with a Grant that covers my school feesThey do have Chik-fil-la and subway but not to many options in the UCIt all depends on what do you prefer. Wifi, computer access, and party they have. If you are looking for peace and quite ad a place to study not going to happen. Good thing the library is closeThe options for off campus housing are limited and some of the places are very sketchy and dangerous. The housing office is not very helpful when it comes to this option.A student has to drive to find places off campus and not very many options offer discounts.there are not enough officers for the whole campus. Incidents are always occuring and the criminals don\\'t seem to ever get arrested. Parking is the worst. A person has to drive to different lots to be able to find parking, it is ridiculous that a cuple hundred dollars is spent on the parking ticket and very little options for paking are available.The process was long, I got a lot of money but that only covered my tuition and I was left with no options for rent, health insurance or books. I was not pleased with Financial Aid.The cafeteria offers only carbs and very little salad options and not much variety of options. The plates are very expensive,  and not worth the money. The appareal at The POD should be available for purchase with the Dining Dollars and this money should also be available for use at the CollegePark restaurants.Though the facilities are really nice and privacy is insured, the cost of living is very expensive and the requirements to pay for    cafeteria food in order to live in an specific builiding is absurd. More money is spent on the dorms that living on a regular apartment. Also, finding apartments on campus for out of state or international students is a hassle and a very long process.I love off campus and I love it. No dealing with the housing office and no on-campus rules or restrictions. Cost may be a little high but more privacy options are available.Lots of options and many places to eat that have student discounts. The prices aren\\'t the best but hey we have to eat.I do not party so I don\\'t know the best \"party scene\" but I do know that the best way to have a good time is to have good friends.Will give you a ticket for coughing while crossing the street.I\\'ve heard great things about it and people never seem to have problems with it.Although the meal plans are expensive and the food quality is low in the connection cafe it is food and for a hungry college student it works. The Plaza has good options that are available often. Einsteins is great for all coffee and bagel lovers, and is on the other side of campus which give variety.The housing has two worlds here at UTA. There are very old housing options and very new housing options. for the new ones they are clean and spacious but the amenities are lacking. The washers and dryers hardly ever work, shower water pressure was minimal, fixtures would often break and fending machines were rarely on or working. The old ones are dirty, and not spacious at all. No elevators in them and that limits the handicapped.I looked for an apartment either near campus or on campus, and ended up choosing on campus. The off campus housing is more expensive overall because not all utilities are included in the outrageous rent. On campus has utilities included. The off campus ones are not near as safe either, I have heard many bad things about the nearby off campus apartments as far as safetyI am not a party person, so I don\\'t know how the good the parties actually are. However I have heard about a lot of parties and so there\\'s definitely a party sceneI prefer to eat off campus. It is usually cheaper than on campus, and being in Arlington there are a ton more of options.I have not been here very long, but it seems like the policies are pretty strict. I parked outside an office building for 5 minutes while I was inside fixing paperwork and when I cam out my car was being towed.Financial aid from the school (apart from fafsa) is given out based on set rules. Only the smartest people really get financial helpThe meal plan is too expensive so I have not had one. The restaurant options on campus are great though! There are many choicesI really like the size and location of the school. It also has so many great opportunities.I would not know about off campus housingEverything UTA does is very good and strict.I looked at the school scholarships but it was too late to applyYou always have food even if you run out at your dormLiving on campus is fun and exciting! You get in on all the extra activities!UTA isn\\'t a big sports schoolThere are lots of places within walking distance of campus that it\\'s pretty affordableThe president is not willing to listen to student grievances.The connection cafe is awful, but the plaza has really good fast food.There are so many options for off-campus dining, since some places on campus close early and aren\\'t open on the weekends.They are very nice, they are not too strict. They however are very strict when it comes to drug use on campus.I turned my financial aid in January, but apparently was missing something I didn\\'t find out until the day before the final deadline.The dorms are nice, if you want something more spacious choose the South Side (all girls side), if you want something that is still spacious but all so a bit crowded then choose the north side (Co-ed).The campus is very strict about rules and regulationsI stay on campus, so I have no idea what off-campus housing is like. But from what I hear you have more freedom. Plus, you can live by yourself and having a random roommate sucks. You need to room with someone you know in a dorm, or else you\\'re better off staying in an apartment solo.There are a few places within walking distance, but it is either a pizza or chicken joint.I haven\\'t gone to too many parties this year, but typically if a fraternity or sorority is involved I hear the parties are good.In my year at school I have witnessed anyone really getting in to trouble for alcohol or drugs. You usually see in the school paper that someone has been charged or arrested for possession. But it\\'s not like it happens everyday.Apply as early as possible. The sooner you apply the better off you will be to get the aid you need.The food is usually tasty, but sometimes there isn\\'t much variety. The best way to use your dining dollars is to buy some food for the weekend, especially if you\\'re meal plan doesn\\'t allow you to eat in the cafe on the weekends. If you just eat in the cafe all week, and buy a couple of meals for the weekend it\\'ll help you save money.The dorms are a very great option. They give you an opportunity to meet a lot of new people, and there are plenty of events to help you meet those who are similar to you in character. It\\'s costly for the newer dorms, but if you aren\\'t worried about being in one of the newly built dorms the cost is not too bad.The housing at UTA is great quality wise. ITs just the cost of living there is so high. I don\\'t understand how people can pay for them while being a full time student. They range from $600 to $800 a month. That is way out of my budget zone. If I could I would live in the apartments in a heart beat but I just can\\'t afford it.The costs on campus are really high. Some people can pay for it but others still have to break a limb and give an arm and a leg just have one meal. It could lower some because we are college students and our funds are very limited.It is very reasonable. They aren\\'t over and beyond in most parts of the schools but there are some parts of the school that try and treat people like they are still high school students instead of grown adults getting their education.I don\\'t really go to parties. It\\'s not that I don\\'t like parties because some are okay but I would rather sit back and have an awesome movie night instead.I don\\'t get any money from the school itself but i get state money from my fafsa. I got accepted later in the year and by the time I got accepted they were done giving out money even though I was a transferring honor student from phi thetta. Even though I worked really hard this year and got into the Honor society organization I am still recieving no money from the school itself and because I have to have my parents tax information the money I was getting that got me by decreased. I\\'m am going to have to work alot harder or I may end up having to transfer to another school where I can get in and do better financially at, which is the last thing I want to do, because I really like UTA.It could be better, especially in the cafe area and in the area with the different fast food places. Some places don\\'t cook their food long enough or it is left out to long and is stale or soggy.A few of the dormitories are priced well but they are the older buildings and they don\\'t have the new renovations. The other dormitories that are newer are way more expensive and are like high end apartments.Very diverse and many new events.My experience once in the school of Social Work was great. I met great people and the professors for the most part love what they do and transmit that to the students.UTA offers great orientation if you\\'re coming in straight from high school, but if you are a transfer it is very confusing.I have been to the MAC and it is really nice facility to work out in.Off campus dining is pretty good. There\\'s a lot of variety when it comes to cuisine and prices are fair.The school is actually pretty lenient when it comes to student social lives.My financial aid experience was horrible. UTA financials department is very rude and uncooperative. They do not keep you informed or give you any advising on how to go about financial aid.UTA campus has a great variety of food all around, which is greatly appreciated.I live on campus, so therefore i\\'m not that familiar with off-campus housing. I love living on campus.I wish some places would consider student discounts, however it\\'s not too expensive.The campus enforces policies as they see necessary, and are pretty strict when it comes to parking for sure. But i don\\'t think they are too strict or too lenient.If you\\'re wanting to party, it\\'s not hard to find out where the party is. There is generally always something going on and everyone is generally always invited.I feel like the process is easy, and just a matter of filling out the application. However, you do have to look early for application deadlines because it\\'s important you apply for financial aid and scholarships on time.I love all of the food on campus and the fact that there is plenty of variety to choose from.I live in the lofts apartments and I absolutely love them. I have a roommate, and I love the availability of privacy when needed.Ultimately, I played volleyball at UTA for one semester, but I major in Nursing, so I had to choose between the two. Lastly, I feel like ever since UTA lost/dropped its football program everything that is revolved around athletics is just about average. I mean, without football, some people don\\'t even know where you\\'re located much less if you even exist!This would get an overall average rating and review from me. I never had anyone go out of their way to help me find off-campus housing options, but I have never had any serious issues when it came to searching and finding convenient housing options off-campus. As long as you have a smart phone, know how to work the internet-specifically google- and know at least two people that also attend UTA than you are at a way better advantage than most people!I really don\\'t have much to say about the campus strictness at UTA because I have never lived on campus to know about the issues with noise, alcohol, partying, dorm visiting, and protesting. I can say I know that parking is quite strict and you can almost bet that if you park in one of the lots without a parking permit sticker, with a permit sticker but park the car in the opposite direction facing traffic, or parking in the faculty parking lot or in a parking spot that is intended for university affiliates only than you will come out of that situation with a ticket, which range between $25-$50 depending on the severity of the parking violation committed. Lastly, when it comes to attendance I would say that UTA is pretty average when it comes to the professors requiring attendance and it really just depends on which professor you\\'re taking because they\\'re all different.When it comes to financial aid, I would say that the overall process that takes places when you\\'re filling out your FAFSA for ANY university is going to naturally be a strenuous, frustrating process, unfortunately. For UTA I never really experienced a lot of problems when it came to receiving the adequate amount of funds I estimated that I would need to survive, other than the simple fact of having to remember every year when it was time to either renew or file a new FAFSA for that year. I have always been fortunate to have enough aid given to me that took care of everything, as well as receiving a refund of whatever was leftover, so that truly helped when it came to buying my books, having to buy a laptop in the beginning, and getting all of the basic school supplies bought that eventually would always add up to costing more than what it seemed. UTA is known for having a very reasonable and lower cost of tuition and fees verses other schools in Texas, and they really are affordable for the education that I am wanting to complete.I would have to say that the overall food and dining options on campus are pretty well-balanced and provide a pretty good variety of options when it comes to choosing what you want to eat! I especially love a few things about the food options on campus: they have at least, to my present knowledge, 2 different Starbucks locations within the dining building; they have a lot of my ultimate favorite food genres, like Chik-Fil-A, Panda Express (yum!), Subway, and the absolute best one there- Sushi! The campus has a huge building that consists of their main dining hall holding those major food places mentioned, along with some convenient vending machines located in almost every building on campus and some snack bars; one of my favorites is the mini-convenient store that they have located in one of the buildings, which this places carries everything from any food that can be categorized as junk food, healthy snacks, a wide variety of drinks to choose from, small-sized convenient foods that which can be microwaved, like to-go soup, mac-n-cheese over stovetop or microwave, to many more options that are perfect for people that live on-campus in a dorm! On the other side of the store, they usually have pre-cooked meals that are hot-n-ready to go when you\\'re in a rush during your lunch break in-between classes and switch up the options to choose from for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which are really super yummy; they also give you the option to make a bagel, grab a muffin, choose from yogurt, sushi, juices, and assortments of fruit. Lastly, they have fresh-brewed coffee more morning goers or for the people who require coffee at all hours of the day and a pretty awesome cappuccino machine! In regards to places available that aren\\'t essentially located inside a building, UTA also has a major road that is lined with different restaurants, fun sporty bars, and sweet little local food joints that you can utilize as a hangout place with your colleagues!The Mac always has machines available!Lots of good food on Cooper st.!Haven\\'t really been to many partiesIt was an easy process and i received enough to cover my tuition and booksThe connection cafe is not very good but the new restaurant La Blue Casa is delicious!!The Campus is great and there are a lot of friendly people!Our Greek life is one of the biggest things on campus as well.I think the sports are a really big thing at our school. Even though we don\\'t have a football team, we still show spirit through other sports such as basketball, wheelchair basketball, cheerleading and intramurals.I\\'m pretty satisfied with the off campus dining. They have a wide variety of ethnical foods and fast foods.I think our school\\'s rules are fairly strict. Very reasonable.I\\'m not really a party person, but it is nice to see friends get together and interact.If you do FAFSA on time you will usually have no problem getting money.There\\'s plenty of options to eat on campus, but not places I prefer. But, there are many places of walking distance that are very good.Hardly ever see or hear about any problems at schoolNot much input/help from financial aid officeI stayed at the Southeast campus of Tarrant County College, which is located in Southeast Arlington. The city of Arlington is a large area, and so off-campus dining comes with many diverse options.Students who do not have parking passes will receive a fine. Campus police make rounds around the parking lot and ensure that all vehicles have a pass. One issue that I have found regarding the visitors\\' parking lot is that the area is completely packed, and the lot recently expanded.Tarrant County College District was, by far, the best decision for my education. I enjoy the instructors, who take a hands-on approach to teaching, as well as the building itself. Recently, the schools added lounge areas throughout the institutions that make studying easier when waiting for class to begin. I did not live on the campus; however, I was pleased to have the ability to stay with my parents and focus on striking a balance between a full-time education and a full-time job. I strongly recommend any high school student to consider beginning their degrees at a local community college, so that they may attend a great institution at a more affordable price.The cost can add up, but many restaurants around the campus allow for a discount with a student id.The subjects that need strictness are the ones that are the most strict. The parking could be a little more lenient, as tickets for parking in a way that allows the students to get out easier, is not needed.I was able to receive financial aid last semester and this semester quite smoothly, but for the next year it has been more difficult. Make sure you fill out the FAFSA.There\\'s quite a variety of food to choose from so you\\'re not bored with the same meal everyday. The price can become quite high if food is bought on restaurants on campus everyday. The environment is very friendly which allows for good eating.I lived off campus for some time in an apartment. You had to beat the city traffic and the area was just okI have been to many restarurants off campus but not many are conveneiently located. It tsakes at least 15 minutes to get anywhere decent.I don\\'t think theyre too strict here. I think laws should be upheld as it can be dangerous on this campus.I don\\'t party but there\\'s not much going on campus for me and though I would be interested in some fun, there\\'s way too many bad things that happen at night on campus. This is not a party school.  I have treated it as a commuter school. I come only for classes and leave immediately after.I applied for only scholarships with Gooldsby Leadership Academy and Federal Student Aid. I have heard very little about good financial scholarship options at my school.I have given up eating on campus. I would rather drive to find the same or better food for much cheaper.The dorms range from decent to nice. All are expensiveI live off campus and it\\'s great so much better than a dorm. I get my own room and bathroom and have pretty much complete freedom.I usually eat off campus and there are some great places, you just have to drive to them.I feel like the campus is just as strict as any other campus.Filling out Fafsa is a pain and the financial aid office is always busy when you try to call.The food options they offer like Panda Express, Subway, and Chick-Fil-A are awesome because these are some of my favorite places to eat. I often eat one of them between my classes for lunch.I live in an off campus apartment that is down the street from the campus. It is vey convenient because I can walk to all my classes and avoid paying for parking registration. Being so close to the campus allows for me to go to many different activities and events that are on campus that I would miss out on if I lived farther away and would have to commute. My apartment is very nice and includes various amenities.The food is good, although I do consider the meal plan to be quite expensive its overall not that bad. I love Pie Five the pizza place, the dining dollars I\\'m happy with etcI love the campus! its big and diverse, everyone is friendlyContacting special departments can be difficult at this school. But the classes online and the layout of are really good.UTA is the most diverse school I\\'ve been to, and it adds some uniqueness to it. Apart from their excellent academics, they have plenty of extra curricular activities to be a part of. It is an honor to be a Maverick!Very great school. Always expanding to create new opportunities for different students. Lots to eat in the area and dorm rooms are always availableEveryone here is so nice. The campus is absolutely beautiful. There is always some event going on, with something to do.Beautiful campus.  I\\'m about to start this fall as a sophomore.   Can\\'t wait ti get started.  Wonderful councilors and help from all the staff.  I was worried that I would or could get lost in registration.  But it was pretty straight forward and with the help of the staff it did not take anytime at all.UTA was not originally my first choice but after joining I came to like it quite a lot. The campus is actually quite large but the main areas of focus are very near that it doesn\\'t feel that big. It is known for it\\'s diverse student population and has quite an active campus.I loved it so much, everyone is so nice! Little no to parties, there is never a dull moment on campus.The community, staff and students, are very friendly and the environment is kind of clean and very welcoming. Aside from the many constructions currently being operated, the school life is very calming and peaceful.The University of Texas (at Arlington) is a very good college. The first thing that stands out at UTA is the diversity of the students and teachers. So many people, cultures and backgrounds exist here and get along comfortably. The campus environment is very open to its freshmen, with many clubs, groups and general people friendly to new people regardless of pedigree. Several teachers at UTA have already presented themselves as possessing open insight and clear knowledge. It has been refreshing to see college teachers with unique and effective teaching skills combined with realistic outlooks on student ability. Out of class there are many organizations to put ones time too, plus a decently outfitted rec center where one can focus on things other than class. The school itself provides a good balance between effective academics and places to decompress; a real students school.Love the friendly enviroment. The students and faculty are great to students and will help you in the right direction.I am a transfers student, and the transferring process went very smooth. The academic team are all very nice and they keep you up to date with everything you have to do for everything to go as easy as possible.I am finding the transition to be very difficult. Because of that my gpa has suffered. This will be my third semester and I plan pn it being a much better onr. I am hoping to get my gpa back up to 3.4.I like the classes and the living options. It\\'s more of a commuter college so if you want to party and go to a lot of events this is not the school for you but overall it\\'s a great school with many helpful resourcesUTA is mostly composed of commuter students so there is not a strong sense of school community or school spirit. If that does not matter to you and you intend to focus on your studies rather than parties or sports, then this school might be a good fit. If you\\'re looking for a sense of community you will most likely not find that here. The academics at UTA are very good and there are many amazing professors in all subject areas. The campus is lovely and tuition is very affordable.The University of Texas at Arlington is a school that has a diverse staff and student community. nnThe students are courteous and give a helping hand when one needs it. There is plenty of support for students whenever they are facing obstacles or difficult personal situations. nnThe professors are helpful and there when you need them. Some of our adjunct professors are extremely passionate about what they teach and they bring in industry experience to the classroom and teach the students applicable material in addition to the curriculum of the courses from the school.  nnThe environment is friendly, comforting, and competitive. It pushes us as students to be and do our best at all times.You have to be prepared to do a lot of self teaching at this school.  The professors read off of the powerpoint presentation the entire time. Read your text books and quiz yourself. You\\'ll definitely learn how to study at this school.I absolutely love UTA. They have many older instructors with years of experience. They have a variety of programs and the campus is diverse. I feel that I am receiving the best academically. The tuition is affordable and it is one of the largest universities in Texas. Not only do they offer on campus programs but you can also do programs on-line no matter where you live in the state or country. Online programs provide coaches to help you daily if needed and you also have an instructor. Technical support available anytime. The only thing I can say is that it can be annoying having to wait 24hrs for a response via email if you need help because you can\\'t call. Other than that it has been an awesome experience and I would recommend this school to everyone. Nursing students should not hesitate. Go for it!It\\'s such a great university to attend. The professors are very helpful and the services the university offers are helpful & beneficial for students. The only thing I would change is the parking, it\\'s so far away.I currently attend University of Arlington it is a great school I\\'m in the online program and teachers are super nice they have staff there to help you every step of the way form start which is applying for a program to graduation.Ive loved UTA so far it has been an amazing campus and I couldn\\'t expect anything else from a campusI have looked into it and there is a bit of varietyThere is a mall a few minutes from campus and if you drive out a bit further you can usually find something that will suit your needsThey do what they believe is bestI had a pleasant experience; all questions i had were always answeredI find that there is plenty for me to choose from, however it is a bit expensiveI do not stay on campus, but it looks great and my friends are very satisfied with their dormsOff campus housing is very convenient if you want more privacyGreat variety of options and great priceFinancial aid process was very easy, staff are great at helping through the entire processThe best parties happen within the sororities and fraternities, they are the bestDorms are great, very satisfied with my housing environment so farI\\'m working on a B.A. that was recently created and will be one of the first people to graduate with this degree.Every professor I\\'ve had has been very passionate about their work.It\\'s not the best, but it\\'s cheap and it\\'s okay, which fits for college students.There\\'s some sense of strictness and it keeps everyone in check for the most part.I feel like scholarships should be easier to get and should offer more money.There\\'s not really a party scene, unless you\\'re involved in Greek life.It\\'s not the best food, but it\\'s still food and I need to eat.Some dorms are great, but other ones could use a renovation. I feel like many of the dorms that offer rooms with two occupants could have larger rooms, just so there\\'s a little more room. The dorm I live in has thin walls, so maybe thicker walls would be something to consider. Price wise, dorms are affordable in most cases.off campus housing is relatively expensive and not worth the money. incredibly ghetto everywhereThey take advantage of students by ticketing them for every possible offense they can come up with.It is incredibly hard to qualify for any aid at this school and they charge a ridiculous amount of fees to extort more and more money from students.I dont participate too much in partying but there are celebrations quite frequently.There are a lot of different choices for food in both the university center and the surrounding area.It is really expensive to live on campus and the dorms arents even worth the money it cost to live in them.I got a legit scholarshipThere is a lot of weed smoking in arlington hallThey have all of the optionslots of variety, but very expensive.Food in this town is very good!They have VERY specific rules. Especially in the dorms. As long as you don\\'t go out of your way to break them though, don\\'t worry too mcuh.Got great scholarships! Looking for more now!Not a lot of parties. Like....at all.The cafe is aweful! However, Pie Five seems to counterract it with awesome pizza. Totaly recomend getting the meal plan with the most college park dollars.I live in KC hall. The rooms and amenities are great. However, there are very few washing machines. These are almost always the cause of community strife. Other than that, the rooms and facilities are amazing.Off-Campus Dining is a must, since there is a small variety On-Campus.The administrations are very kind and helpful most of the time.I got my FAFSA amount. Some more scholarship options are needed.Not much diversity, but it\\'s okay on the wallet.They are pretty pricey but a good distance from the school.The popular places closed down. So there isn\\'t much of a variety now.They\\'re strict when it comes to parties. But they are pretty much fully aware of whats going on and they are always passing by the schoolI would say, apply for scholarships also because everything added up together could get expensiveMost parties are in the on campus apartments or organizations give them at different places around the areaThe cafeteria food is okay on certain days. The best places to go to are the on campus restaurants and the places that are located in college parkEverything is nice and within the same area of the school which is pretty coolIf I do go out to eat, it\\'s usally at one of these restaurants. Cooper street and Parks Mall offers a huge variety of eating.I haven\\'t any run ins with the UTA police. However, they are VERy strict on parking! Do NOT park in the teacher\\'s parking lots or you WILL get a ticket!Although I am still leary about using student loans, UTA was great about providing the funds I need to complete my graduate degree.As a commuter student, I don\\'t have a lot of time to attend campus parties. However, before I graduate I have a goal to attend a homecoming bash - it looks like so much fun!Every time I have eaten there, it has been good. However, I am a broke college student - I can\\'t really afford to go out to eat all of the time. So, I don\\'t eat there as often as I would like.I love the graduate program way more than UTA\\'s undergraduate program. The classes are smaller so the students are more likely to know each other. It creates a more comfortable learning atmosphere compared to 200 students who don\\'t talk.I\\'ve had no issue with adminIt was easy to applyI don\\'t really  attend campus partiesI think the variety is good.It\\'s about average compared to other schools I\\'ve seenI personally don\\'t care much about sports but I appreciate the work put into the sports programs at UT Arlington.I have lived in Arlington for most of my life. I enjoy it. I like the fact that many friends and family are within an hour and a half from Arlington.Many students are busy with their social life and their needs that they have no desire to give in a friendship. I would be willing to be their friend if they had any desire to be mine.I definitely plan on doing an internship. I have to have observation hours for my major. I am really not sure how to accomplish this goal as of yet but I plan on talking to my advisor.I have not experienced the strictness or leniency of the dorms. Therefore it is difficult to give it a true rating.I had struggles because of my parents challenges and complications with taxes. It has been such a hassle that I was unable to receive any financial aid.I live in a house owned by my church and backed by a student organization. I love living there!Just apply through FAFSA, fairly easy process. Students will receive the aid needed.Campus really follows school\\'s honor code. I love the fact that nobody can smoke in public, really big pro for coming here.Dorms could be better than expected. Everyone is so friendly and sociable. Teachers are great. Cost is the same for any UT-system schools. A bit more expensive for on-campus students. Housing process is fairly easy. All incoming freshmans will be scared and will think it\\'s scary, but it really isn\\'t.Getting into my program is fairly easy. I encountered no challenges. Most important would maybe be grades and GPA.Our campus has a really secure campus and it makes you feel safe.This campus is safe and secure. There are some issues going on such as theft, and assault. However, the police and special security agents do their best to keep everyone safe and resolve issues. They have a system of sending bulletin emails about any issue taken place right away to alert everyone on campus. I feel pretty safe on campus even if it is an open campus. The students here are pretty good - we can trust them with our belongings if we left it for few minutes. They keep an eye on our stuff. Since it is an open campus, people who do not belong to campus are the ones who create issues. But the cops are pretty quick to catch them.Many people are really involved, but sports are not my thing.It\\'s is convenient to live on campus but they always fill up so easily, hence most of the students commute. I have looked around to move in on-campus apartments but they are expensive. It is easier to stay away and in our comfortable place of our choice than moving in here. The space is alright but the overall look of buildings aren\\'t so great. Depending on the location of apartments, some are safe and some are not. Social atmosphere isn\\'t bad plus we get to meet a lot more people from the university. Distance wise it is pretty convenient - 15-20 minutes walk and you reach the university.I did not apply for financial aid so I cannot really comment on that. However, I have heard from some students that it is a bit of a hassle but they received the financial aid they needed.The Greek life here is pretty average. There\\'s not much going on since most of the students here don\\'t live on campus and commute. But their parties are fun and they try to raise funds and make changes on campus in their small ways. The non-Greeks look at Greek students indifferently, and vice verca. However, the Greek students do encourage non-Greeks to join their fraternities.Very good places to eat off-campus for those with a car.Living off-campus is very expensive and far from school especially for students with no car. Parking wouldn\\'t be worth it for students living off-campus because there is hardly anywhere to park unless you want to pay about $10 for that day.Party scene is fun here. Nothing bad has happened.The food at the market is ridiculously expensive, but at least it\\'s nearby if you\\'re in a pinch.There are people from all backgrounds at school and there doesn\\'t seem to be any animosity between groups.I like being an art major. Guidance is easy to come by and class sizes are small for studio work.It wasn\\'t bad at all. For art, you aren\\'t required to submit a portfolio until you\\'ve taken a few classes, so it\\'s nice to have some guidance in that sense.I\\'m getting a teaching certification, so I will be student teaching eventually. It seems like a pretty easy process and internships for other options are good.Good professors. Some interesting class options. I\\'m an art major and most of the studio classes are small, allowing for individual attention.I love being an art major. The teachers are all active in the field and very passionate about their work.Good options, but they\\'re very spread out, which I guess is a good and bad thing.I live in off-campus student apartments and I like it. They\\'re really nice and somewhat affordable.I\\'ve lived in the Arlington area my whole life. Great shopping, but some parts of the city are very unsafe.The health clinic is pretty good and the police are readily available.I met my boyfriend here. It\\'s pretty easy to meet people.Not too bad. Chipotle and Potbelly are within walking distance. McDonald\\'s and Wendy\\'s are also.I don\\'t party so I don\\'t know.I\\'m not Greek so I don\\'t know.I wish they had more scholarship opportunities for the \"average\" student. Most are based on GPA, organizations, or transfer. They\\'re hard to get.I toured some apartments and there are only 2 good communities here, really. The others are old and somewhat trashed. I ended up living off campus.I don\\'t know much about the living on campus policies because I live off campus, but everything else is good.No football team, but I kind of like that. It keeps the school close knit.n/a I am an online studentn/a I am online studentAlright, you can get help.We have more restaurants around the campusGet to know other cultures.I\\'m currently in nursing, and I have to say that the academics are very rigorous but it inspires me even more to become something bigThere is plenty of variety.It gets the job done. There is plenty of variety.I know that the Greek Life has events that help support people in the community or the campus. I feel that some non-Greeks view Greeks as people who pretty much buy their own friends during college, people who are rich, or people that like to party.There are a lot of places to eat off campus.I just feel like the parking is horrible. I feel like the school makes more money from parking tickets than tuition.It\\'s very hard to get financial aid and it\\'s not a very transparent process. It\\'s just a very difficult process to find scholarships catering to students at school and its offered to very specific groups.I wish there were more options to get around.It\\'s definitely a lot better than I thought it would be.I don\\'t really care for it that much to be honest.I feel pretty safe on campus.I don\\'t really party that often or at all to be honest.Athletic events do not get full mostly because a lot of students who attend are commutersI wouldnt say its the best but it is not the worst. Living off campus is a lot cheaper than dorms not to mention the added space and freedom makes it way worth it.I really like the engineering program at UTA. It is very challenging and time consuming but I feel like I have learned a lot so far and I believe it is prepping me well for when I get a job in this field.One good thing about the cops on campus is that if you are ever at school late and would like someone to walk with you to your car, they will be glad to do it all you need to do is call them.I do not live on campus so I don\\'t know how strict they are about dorms. However I do know professors are very strict about the honor code but I believe that is at any university.There are quite a few things close to UTA such as the Cowboys AT&T stadium, the Rangers ballpark, Six Flags as well as a few malls.The first couple weeks everyone on campus is really friendly and willing to go out of their way to talk to you. After that everyone gets caught up in there classes and don\\'t seem to venture past their group of friends muchThe food court is pretty good, and the connection cafe is pretty lacking. The college park district is dying left and rightThe sports life on campus is small but the MAC is an amazing gym that I\\'m extremely happy that I can use.I\\'m not very happy with the financial aid. I receive Hazelwood act so they told me they couldn\\'t offer me the Pell Grant money. fast forward a year and my girlfriend tells me that she receives both and so does everyone she knows. So they screwed me out of money that should have been awarded to me.It\\'s the normal fast food options that are everywhereI have a shared room in A-hall and it\\'s very nice considering a lot of the other rooms on campus. Perfect size for one person but your forced to share with someone else. A-hall and Vandgergriff are probably the best housing situations on campus.Most of the parties are in the on campus appartmentsNot the biggest greek life on campus but they actively recruit you in the beginning of fall semester.The architecture program is pretty good, however it seems like its best days were in the 90\\'s. I would definitely recommend it as an undergraduate program.I have seen an issue arise the last couple semesters I have attended. Usually a frat gets in trouble for underage drinking.Not the best area of town. The campus is alright but the area around it is alittle sketchy.Safety and security are very important on campus. Staff doesn\\'t leave any stone unturned to prohibit crimes and sexual assault. I feel very safe even at 12 am when I go to my apartment from library.The athletic facilities are good but students do not always participate as they spend most of their time studying. During holidays, most of the students pays attention to sports. Of course its not the big part of campus life.There are not many apartments and so students have a hard time searching for an apartment. Most of the spacious apartments are not close to campus and the apartments close to campus are not spacious. Students are adjusting a lot here and sometimes it even affects studies.I have this great opportunity of studying at University of Texas at Arlington. Students who graduate from this University have to make little efforts landing a job as the coursework is good and so the students acquire lot of skills in diverse aspect by the time they graduate.There are a lot of nice looking women and handsome men on campus. However I can\\'t give the best assessment given that I am married and don\\'t pay much attentionI think the athletics is great. We win a lot of games and I see a lot of team support. However I think the school would get more interest if it had a football team.I grew up in the area and I love the atmosphere of the city!UTA has very strict rules about academic dishonesty, alcohol use, and drug use on campus!The area around UTA isn\\'t the safest area, but the campus police provide escorting services every day of the week with good hours! Especially at night, the police will walk you to your car if needed, in order for you to feel safe on campus. I see campus police driving around or walking around constantly!UTA is one of the most diverse campuses in the nation and state of Texas, so there are tons of restaurants in the area that come from all walks of life. From Indian to Pakistani to Greek to Mexican to Vietnamese food, you can never go wrong with the restaurants off campus!I\\'m not in a sorority but some of my coworkers and friends are in sororities and fraternities and they absolutely love it! It\\'s a pretty big part of campus life but if you don\\'t end up joining Greek life none of the people treat you differently or judge you. Greek life is very accepting on UTA.UTA has a really good Athletic Training/Kinesiology degree program! And UTA also has one of the best nursing programs in the state, and that is my fall back plan if I don\\'t end up continuing in the AT/Kines major! All of the faculty are very knowledgeable and have great experience in the fields of work!I\\'m not really a big partier, but I have a lot of sorority and fraternity friends who host parties often! I\\'ve attended a few and they\\'re pretty fun!Sports are pretty big at UTA and I typically attend all of the games and sporting events I can! Although, there isn\\'t a football team and that is what the university is really lacking, but maybe in the next 5-6 years there will be one! But ultimately, I love UTA and the sports and teams. It\\'s like one big family!Over all I absolutely love UTA! It was one of my top choices in schools! Both of my parents are alumni and my mom works on campus in the College of Education, so my parents love the school as well. The sports atmosphere is awesome and everyone really gets into the volleyball, basketball, softball, and baseball games! Although, I really wish there was a football team. But hands down I love the cost of tuition and the faculty is really awesome on campus! They love to be hands on and give you any kind of help or resources you need.Its a suburban city so if you\\'re into that, its a great cityNot bad if you\\'re yearning for freedomDepending n how much you are willing to pay, the off-campus housing will help you accordingly.Im sure its great I just haven\\'t gotten around it yetI think UT Arlington views varsity sports as an option for those who are interested.I did not have any problem with it at all.Nursing is one the main majors there so it has a lot of attention. Since it is one of best nursing schools, the program is really difficult to get in and they expect a lot out of you.There not really there but i haven\\'t herd of any polices affecting parties or lives.Class sizes are to big and crowded but at the middle of the semester nobody showed up to class. Professors are like anywhere else, there are some good ones and bad ones.There is a lot of attractions around there like 6flags, cowboys stadium, the rangers stadium and parks mall right next to each other.UTA is somewhat sheltered from the Arlington area.There are plenty of restaurants in the area.I am not in Greek life, but many of my friends are and most of the people do not fit the typical Greek stereotype.the parties are safe and well organizedthe administration take the safety of the students and staff very seriously.I really enjoy UT Arlington.Although we don\\'t have football, the sports we do have are enjoyable. We also have an indoor rockwall!I don\\'t do greek but I have quite a few friends who do.We are located in the middle of  city. Bad things occasionally happen.Lots of places to find some good food.I dont live off campus, but the apartments are abundant and close!It\\'s not bad but you realy need to pay attention to the cost relative to what you are getting.It\\'s an average school, filled with average bureaucracy.It is located in the Dallas Ft. Worth Metroplex which is one of the most entertaining spots in Texas!I am just starting my EE degree program, and it is very interesting because they are \"revamping the system\" to keep it up to date!Overall this has been a new experience for me and has taught me a lot about making that transition from a high school student to all on your own college student. my mentality has changed a lot, i am now more focused in my education.It is not bad at all. Sometimes the dining options close a tad earlier sometimes but otherwise plenty to choose from and satisfying options.It is a bad experience and very costly. My FASFA never went through because of the formatting but they informed me after I approached them the first day to move in and i had sent it since before my summer.They are students just like us and they don\\'t want anything mischievous going on and noise to be kept at a minimum during sleeping hours.I love living on campus, it has taught me new experiences i had never had before. Occasionally, the people above us would decide to stomp on the ground but other than that It was great.It is okay, I am more into studying to get good grades for my classes and therefore i do not have the time to party.One of my classmates lives in the apartments by UTA and so far he loves it there.We have highly competitive teams and club organizations that really make the students feel apart of them.I feel generally safe in and around campus, I do not feel as if anyone would be in any danger walking by themselves.There is a wide variety of restaurants to go to at all times of the day, and they are all convenient.There is always something fun and interesting to do, both on and off campus.I love my on-campus apartment! It is very nice and clean. Also, it came with all of the amenities that I desired.While the prices may be great, the quality is terrible. Most off-campus housing looks old and run-down.The financial aid that the school gave me only covered half of what I needed it to. It wasn\\'t too difficult to apply for though.UTA does not have a football team and in Texas, football is a big thing! For this campus, basketball is the biggest sport and not many people care to mention anything about games. Sporting events is one of the least significant things on campus.I love the psychology program at UTA. There are always new ways to get involved in studies and research done by other students, and this has always interested me.While more often than not, there are always campus officers around, there should be more emergency telephones located around campus. In the center of the campus, there are plenty of phones. However, I live on the edge of campus and there are no telephones in sight.I love how UTA really pushes to get all students involved around campus. However, the focus is mainly on fun and not about going to class. The majority of students do not attend class and their grades suffer because of it. I believe that if they were more strict on attendance, students would be more responsible when it comes to going to class and getting their work done. After all, we are here for a better education!MAE is a difficult but helpful program.If you do the correct things, you\\'re fine.The general health in the campus is quite high.They give parking tickets like halloween candy and condoms.I grew up in the area. It isnt New York, but its way better than Lubbock.Mostly chain restaurants and fast food, but there are a good places to eat farther from campus.I grew up in the area and i know it well, so i feel safe on campus and the surrounding area.Get the hell out of here if you want to. Arlington is a city to be only available for old people.It\\'s great for a small College of Political Science! I would not recommend the Graduate program though.It your average everyday University police. The parking police however have gotten tougher.Not the best in the Nation, but very safe if your worried about anything.Every shops that pop up around the area gets closed down..The school is really nice most of the faculty is pretty helpful and even though there isn\\'t a football team, there is a good amount of school spirit. The school has a lot of diversity and between greek life and student organizations I found it really easy to meet great people.The population here at UTA is very diverse, both professors and students. My favorite part of the campus is the MAC (Maverick activity center). The center includes a huge gym which would be covered under your tuition. They offer a lot of fun activities and intramural sports students can get involved in, which would include rock climbing as well.The University of Texas at Arlington offers multiple areas of study, a rigorous curriculum, numerous resources, and dedicated professors. I have experienced excellent service by advisors, as they have all done whatever is necessary to assist me in my education progression. The education I have received thus far will allow for added expertise in my field once I graduate. I am extremely pleased with the quality of my education.My freshman year at UTA was very memorable and i made some lifelong friends. it is scary for the first two weeks but there are so many people who can help you with your questions so that you wont feel lost. And i attended a lot of parties while balancing my academics and i never felt out of place. wherever i would go next i would make new friends. the food is amazing in terms of choices and you have Starbucks there so yeah a pretty good start for the day. the night life around the campus is good. there are a lot of restaurants and the mall is a 10 min drive. the campus os beautiful and everyday there is some new thing going on. so yeah my freshman i was at my top point.Overall this school is pretty great. However, I think placing more emphasis on creating bonds between commuter students will really help with the lacking school spirit. Whether that\\'s by placing more emphasis on our sports teams, or various clubs that don\\'t hold meetings in the evening when majority of the students have gone home. While the faculty and resources can give a school recognition, school spirit increases student drive to attend a university and be a proud student. I do not regret my decision to come here and will be a proud graduate, however I do feel this school is a constant work in progress.The school is average in every sense. There are only 2 good  dorms. There is no football team and therefore limited school spirit. It\\'s a commuter school so make of that what you will. There\\'s not much to do around in Arlington but it is not a college town either. Classes are relatively easy if you come from a competitive climate.I would say that my overall experience with the University of Texas at Arlington was satisfactory. I loved the atmosphere, but the campus needs a little work. I agree with my fellow classmates that there should be an update in the layout and structure of the school. I would change the design of the buildings and how they handle campus security and safety, as there were multiple crimes throughout each semester of my attendance. With the school being most recognized for their nursing and engineering programs, I would highly recommend this university to peers who are interested in those two career paths. The University of Texas at Arlington is reputable in many other areas as well. Overall, I enjoyed my time at the university because I was able to create lasting memories and everyone seems to be so welcoming.Great school with a lot of resources for specific majors only. Strong in engineering, mathematics, and architecture. nThe university has great diversity, great peers, and a great lively group of friendly students. Honestly, love the school even with its simple flaws.Great university at very affordable tuition rates.  UTA is a very good return on investment based on surveys provided by payscale.comOnce i went to the fieldtrip to UTA it seemed very great, the students there were very applicable to what they were doing. I also  believe that school is very great, because it has all of the things it nedds to succeed.This university has the best engineering programs to do while being close to home and many career paths to choose from.Very moderate climate that allows good chances to excel academically. Freedom of choice is present on campus.In my opinion, The University of Texas at Arlington is a special place. There are people from all over the nation and world so there is plenty of diversity. Also, the students and staff members for the most part are kind and great to know. Here is a great place for anyone to build long lasting relationships while getting a quality education in whatever degree you pursue. From the people, to the academics, to the athletics, I recommended at least considering it.I love the diversity at UTA, but I almost feel like I don\\'t get the help I need to plan ahead. I\\'m going to go to graduate school, but I do not understand how I am gonna get there or anything.Excellent school to finish your 4 year degree. Excellent way to take online classes. All of the instructors are very helpful.So far this has been an excellent university! I am doing the online accelerated nursing program and love it. I am able to set the pace and be able to still hold down two jobs and take care of my family. I highly recommend.The people at the school are amazing! Everyone is so helpful and understanding! Only thing I would change is the organization of departments other than engineering and nursing.This review is coming from a commuter. One of the worst issues about this university is parking. Recently the parking at UTA has become an issue due to increased prices for parking permits and the closing down of parking lots for construction. If you care about your education, the professors are willing to help you succeed in any way you can. Overall, I\\'ve had a good experience at this university.I was a little hesitant before transferring to UTA because I did not know very much about this university and its reputation in psychology, my field of study. I was pleasantly surprise about every aspect of this institution. I enjoyed every single one of my classes and the atmosphere is tremendous. I do wish more founding would go towards some buildings other than chemistry and engineering, since those are the main focus of the sponsors, leaving the development of some other buildings unattended. nnUniversity of Texas at Arlington is not only an excellent institution, it is also quite affordable, which is extremely admirable given the struggle that many students go through when seeking a degree.nnThe help I obtained from counselors and teachers was beyond any expectations and definitely shaped my success in my college career. nI successfully attained my bachelor\\'s degree and would highly recommend this University to anyone pursuing a degree.There\\'s a cool commuter rewards program. There are some really good professors. Most classes use a bunch of technology. 5th most diverse university.I like to go watch some games.I love it, it\\'s very convenient.I wish I could get more.Living in an apartment is better.Parking tickets are pretty common.I received enough for the year so I guess that\\'s good.Study first & party later.There are a variety of dining places In college park and they are very accessible.I do not live on campus so I cannot describe how its like to live on campus.The financial aid office does not help and they just tell you the process but does not help.I have never been to party but am pretty sure that they are somewhat fun.There is always something to do. There is the entertainment district with many different attractions.The campus has security and they rnrnare responsible when crimes are committed and make students feel secure.The parking for off campus student is very bad because the availability is very poor.Administration is not very helpfulClass sizes are average and the professor and student relationship can be helpfulGreeks are always recruiting and doing fundraising events and it helps the society to get involved.Entering freshman at UTA get the best scholarships if not a CAPPED student!I think it\\'s average. It\\'s necessary for schools to keep their students in check!My friend loves her apartment and pays cheaper rent!It\\'s all right but from what I hear, home is best!My program is amazing. it has a master degree and bachelor\\'s degree in a 5 year fast track. unforunately, UTA is getting rid of it and I am grandfathered into the program.biomedical engineering is a great major but right now it\\'s difficult to find jobs or internships.The police is very good about keeping things under control.I don\\'t really party all that much though!It\\'s honestly all about average. It\\'s not awful but not amazing! some deals are very nice occasionally.Nursing can be hard but I love it.I plan to have an internship in the future.Many students love the different athletic activities.There are many different groups.Minor fights occur, nothing extraordinaryThe ones i know are pretty cool..Expensive but provides a lot of funStudent discounts all the way..Could be very expensive but the freedom\\'s worth itThe lack of public transport makes it worse.The dining experience is pretty nice. There are a lot of different restaurants to choose from and the cost depends on where you go.There are a lot of restaurants near by which is really convenient for those students who do not have a car. There aren\\'t many activity places near by that I know of, but the MAC has a lot of fun things to do!The process was fairly easy and the program was great.Arlington itself is nice, but the fact that there\\'s no public transportation makes going into the city an adventure in and of itself.I loved living on campus but I could get an apartment for the same cost.The Maverick Promise is one of the main reasons I decided to attend UTA. There is no hassle as long as you meet the required deadlines.I have never had any problems walking alone at night, but I have friends that don\\'t feel safe going out at night.If we didn\\'t have to have a meal plan I would like it a lot better.I can\\'t wait to rush next semester! Greek life is so fun!They are super strict about no smoking but alcohol and underage drinking isn\\'t pushed so much.The police are always roaming around, but you can only keep a huge campus safe to a point.There is a lot of variety but Cooper Street is so busy its hard to navigate.This campus is very safe minus a few issues. The only problem we really had last year were people stealing phones.I am in a sorority and I enjoy it a lot. We don\\'t haze at all and everyone is welcome to join.It\\'s fun, but as a college student who is broke you can\\'t really enjoy a lt of the activities available to those who are already in the working world.I had to go into the Financial Aid office on numerous occasions to make sure everything I turned in would go through. It took a long time for it to take effect, and I ended up having to pay for the majority of my classes on my own due to time constraints.There is a fair amount of protection/security and police presence on campus. Also, alerts are sent to my phone and email about recent incidences.I do not know much about the greek life at my school.There\\'s always something going on for students here on campus. Most of the time, it\\'s free of charge.The sports here are fantastic! We have a little bit of everything, except for a varsity football team. Marching band is wonderful, and school spirit is astonishing.We have numerous fast food restaurants as well as sit down dining establishments. Many of these stores offer either discounts or occasional events for UTA students.The off-campus housing is fantastic. It\\'s quite close to various retail stores and they\\'re right around the corner from convenience stores. They still are within walking distance of campus, plus they\\'re beautiful buildings.Thank to my professor I had access to a great professional internship. I believe they are a great way to step into the real world and gain experience. I highly encourage students to apply for internship and gain the lifetime experience. Workers are usually lenient knowing that you are a student and willing to work around your schedule. Sometimes it may not be the best or dream internship you were looking for, but it definitely opens door for better opportunities.I was in the Business Department (Management). I had a great experience because of the support I received from my professors. They are willing to help and guide students to take the right steps. I wish if there was an option for Bachelors with concentration in HR. However after I joined SHRM I learned tremendous information about HR, Management and fully enjoyed my last year of undergraduate. I highly recommend keeping professors who have real life experience then those who teach from books. Student like me who are visual and verbal learn from experience not books. The facilities for student groups can be improved by providing space and better offices to have meetings and events.There are more options for vegetariansThe students are helpful however when it\\'s busy you are not given all the attentionI believe our basketball team is fabulous.It\\'s great however it can be better specially in the evening. Many students take night classes and I highly recommend having more officers at night.Doesn\\'t apply because I was not part of itI did not live on campus.If you are involved in many organizations the parties are fun and entertaining otherwise you can feel lost.I don\\'t exactly know what is Greek life..I live in in-campus apartment I feel proud that I choose thisI like my school and campusI am not that party person.The financial aid office makes it so easy for the students. They even have a Facebook and a Twitter account for more information.Some Greeks do great things for out community. Greek life is not as important to many people on campus.There is a lot of school spirit. Sports don\\'t seem to be too important to most students on campus.Athletics are a big part of the school as many students take part of it. However, my school isn\\'t a big school like Baylor, and our school teams are very mediocre so there\\'s not a lot of student support for the sports teams.Campus is not very strict about a lot of things, the only thing their pretty strict about that I know of is hazing within the Greek life.I live with my parents. The pros are I save money from having to pay rent, I always have homemade cooking, and I don\\'t have to pay for utilities. The cons are, not a lot of independence, and its a 30 min trip to campus without traffic.There are lots of off campus dining spots for a student to choose from and most of them offer student discounts.There\\'s lots to do on campus in regards to recreation. Lots of clubs and activities to take part in. Outside campus there isn\\'t much to do, a lot of restaurants though.Greek life is very \"meh\". No one really cares for it, there are those who want to be a part of it and those who don\\'t. Either way no one really makes a big deal of whether or not you join. Housing is separate and can be found in a specific area.I received financial aid the first year I attended university, the second year, I was not awarded any because my EFC was too high.Best parties take place at Greek life, and they have a positive impact on student experience.I do not live in campus, I live about 40 minutes away from the collegei will not be living in campus, I will be commuting from home.I have no idea as this is going to be my first semester at UTAi will enjoy being in this program, the classes are not that big, therefore I get to be closer to my instructors.the advisor for my program was very helpful, he explained me what classes i still need to take and how long the process is going to be.there is not much variety of restaurants and attractions options off-campuswhe I went to orientation they talked about the safety of the school.again, I do not live in campus nor i have attended there yet, this will be my first semester at UTA.I commute to school every day, therefore I don\\'t know that much about the off campus housing.i am about to start as a student at UT Arlington this upcoming semester, when I went to the orientation, I noticed that athletics was s big deal for the college.I prefer to live off campus. There is just more freedom that comes with living off campus, not to mention it gives you a sense of having your own home.I\\'m not much or a partier, so I\\'m not really sure. Others say they enjoy it though.I came from a very small town, so there are so many more people than what I am used to. there are many places to go out and have a good time, but there are also places that are better for some down time. It\\'s great because if you want to go out and do something there will always be something to do, but if not you can stay at home and relax.Medicine is great at UTA. It\\'s great to learn new things daily. Facilities are decent and the workload may be heavy at times. Opportunities are never ending when you\\'re willing to take them.Staff on the campus seem to enjoy what they do, making it easier for students on or off campus feel comfortable talking to them about any issues they may have.There are many people of various ethnicities.Studies in visual communications are excellent.There is a decent number of available study labs.There is a satisfactory variety of diners.There are a variety of internships available.The professors are helpful and engaging.There are moderately frequent reports of crime.The school\\'s support of campus teams is vocal.Be sure to apply for financial aid early.Safe drinking practices are encouraged.There is a good variety of malls and restaurants.Housing is good, but prices could be improved.Greek life is interactive and very involved.Do not park without a permit.  It will cost you.  No drinking or smoking allowed on campus but hard to enforce the drinking part.I commute so I have very little knowledge of campus housing except that there is a wide range of choices, especially price-wise.Lots of bars in walking distance with great prices.  Some have music on weekends.  Also Levitt Pavilion in the summer has 4 shows a week in an outdoor venue.So many ethnic groups represented.  LGBT\\'s are a norm in classes, etc.  Very accepting of everyone.One of the few schools that offer the MLA program.  Lots of activities around this program.It is a typical university atmosphere.Dedicated area for the Greek houses.  A big commuter school so not so much emphasis on campus actitivities.Basically like a city.  Lots of variety.Food is not the best but certainly not the worst.  Has some chains in different buildings that makes it easier for those not near the Student Center.  About to complete a huge renovation so expecting it to be even better very soon.Very close to Texas Rangers Ballpark and Cowboy Stadium.  Great access to both Dallas and Fort Worth which have everything you could ever look for including cultural events, museums, night life, incredible eating opportunities and parks.  Only drawback is that public transportation has just started in Arlington.Campus police patrol regularly.  There are alarm kiosks that are easily set off if need be.Modern, up-to-date equipment and facilities.  Free to students and good deals for family.  Has a good variety of classes including yoga, zumba, etc.Arlington is continuing to expand their downtown experience which is very close to the campus.  As it is a suburban area, there are all the chains you want plus many unique restaurants.  It also includes a lot of different ethnic choices.  A lot of places are in walking distance.I simply applied and was accepted after all my necessary paperwork was processed. Transcripts are needed and personal information. As long as you speak with a enrollment advisor its an easy process.I was able to register with ease, I\\'m taking 5 week online courses so the workload should be easy to manageThis program for a Bachelor\\'s in Nursing will prepare to find a job at any hospital both magnet status and non magnet status.I simply applied for the FAFSA and received a Pel Grant that was processed with the school. No headache so faras this was my another  experience in western culture , previous one was in africa , but the things are best here in texas, as I feelI\\'m assuming its great from what I\\'ve heard. This will be my first semester.There are some science majors. Not a lot in my particular field though.There wasn\\'t any difficulty getting into my major.I\\'m a guy so answering this question was a little weird.Health and safety are an important part of any school.I love the diversity of my friends. I\\'m not one to stick with just one race.I don\\'t have off campus housing so I\\'m not sure about it.The local atmosphere is good. Everything is as should be.I\\'m not really into partying so I can\\'t answer to that.It\\'s okay. Not to bad depending on what you like to eat.My English teacher was a excellent teacher. They way she taught was different then my other classes. We would move are chairs around in a circle to have a talk about a section of the book we were reading. She was open to every ones thoughts. We did a lot of group work to which I don\\'t normally like but she would give each group a topic and we would have to explain the topic to the class. I learned a lot in her class because I actually was fully aware of what is going on in class. My criminal justices teacher was also like that when he taught. He would stop lecturing and ask us what we thought and if nobody wanted to answer he would just randomly call on people I really didn\\'t like when he did that because most of the time he would call on people he knows the names of like me for example. I have to say that it helped me focus more in class because I never knew if he would call on me.The services on campus are pretty fast I would say. When every I go to the library, campus store, information office and even the cafÃ© I don\\'t have to wait extremely long. The lines aren\\'t super fast considering there is a line when I wait but I never complain the lines are moving at okay pace. The staff working these services are polite and look like they want to be here. They are help when asked a question.Lots of options to choose from.Online learning is great. I work full time and have a family to care for.  Distance learning is the only way I have been able to go back to school.Just starting. Classes are online.The guys and girls are friendly for the most part but can usually be a little rude.The campus is strict on the right things and lenient on the right things.  Alcohol, drugs, honor code, safety are all things the school takes very seriously.There really is not much that goes on at campus.There are many options available on campus.  I can not get tired of eating there.  It might not be the healthiest but it sure is delicious.The scholarship that the school gave me helped me tremendously.  Even though I still had to pay out of pocket, it was a lot more affordable for me.There are so many resources that one can use to help them pass their classes.  The professors are great and are willing to help.  One can tell that they are passionate about what they teach.I still have a lot of work to do in order to be eligible to apply.  It is a very competitive field.The spirit of the city is very low.  Besides the Ballpark, the stadium and the Six Flags, there is not much of school spirit or excitement all around.It has been an amazing experience so far.  I\\'ve learned so much from all of my professors.More affordable and convenient than on campus lifeNew students hang outs have been builtNew constructed research facilities & campus expansionI rather satisfied with my degree planToo many thefts and assaultsI\\'m not a Greek so I don\\'t really knowVery strict on attendance and honor code no exceptionsWe need more food variety that\\'s affordable.Open mindedness to diverse relationships.Small with a few exciting things, but not much.Lots of work, but flexible and interesting.Very diverse with a variety of schedule options.Sometimes expensive and not up to par.The costs depends on where you go really. I usually take my car to drive to off-campus restaurants just because it is a far walk from the campus itself. Costs varies depending on whether you want healthy or unhealthy food. It\\'s convenient when you\\'re tired of eating at the food court on campus. Some places near school give student discounts like Golden Chick.. that\\'s all I could think of. The best place to check out would be Smiling Moose. That place has very delicious sandwiches. The only thing is that it\\'s kind of expensive for lunch.We don\\'t have a football team so there aren\\'t really any Friday nights celebrations. We do have a baseball, volleyball, tennis, wheelchair basketball team. It gets exciting depending on which sports you like. Our school spirit is mediocre. The athletic facilities are actually pretty amazing. One of the best that I\\'ve been to around here. It\\'s called the MAC at our school and a lot of people go there to socialize and work out.If you take the classes you\\'re advised to take you wont graduate on time. Learn your degree plan yourself. The people in your major\\'s department don\\'t help you.The Mac is absolutely wonderful: top notch equipment, plenty of room, swimming pool, indoor basketball courts and soccer fields, climbing wall, outdoor court, ping pong, pool. The only complaint I have is that we only have two power cages.I see nothing wrong with the facilities here on campus.The cafe has good food every once in a while but I wish it had more variety. Thank goodness we have the plaza to make up for the cafe\\'s mistakes.It\\'s exactly how it\\'s supposed to be. Cops are present but not around every corner.It\\'s really not worth the trouble. Just try to live on-campus.There are ugly people and there are attractive people. It\\'s just like the rest of the world.Strictness doesn\\'t control whether or not people actually obey the rules. So it\\'s kind of useless.Not much to say. They\\'re around. They throw good parties every once in a while.I did dual credit in high school, giving me college credit before actually going to college. I had to go in three different times and tell them that I was an incoming freshman and not a transfer student. Afterwards I found out I did not receive the freshman scholarship I wanted because they mistook me for a transfer student yet again. I went in to correct them once again and ended up receiving the scholarship. It was a hassle but in the end it was worth it. No other school this cheap has scholarships this high.Not a lot to do on the weekends but weekdays are fun.Nothing really note worthy about the campus Facilities, they seem pretty standard.I enjoy being in the Art program, the people are interesting as are the teachers. Most classes are workshops made for students to work on projects and they give plenty of time to work on them.While UTA isn\\'t the best school ever, it\\'s full of the best people and teachers I have ever had the pleasure to know. I\\'m glad I chose to come here instead of some other school.Most Off-Campus dining is fast food, cheap but good.The campus is self-reliant but there\\'s plenty to do.Variety of cultures and fashion here.Being an art major at school can be challenging but overall it\\'s great. The teachers are really helpful and the workload, while tiring at times, never feels too overwhelming.Registering is pretty easy and the classes offered are very good.The health center provided me with plenty of care and help when needed.The food around campus was pretty good overall.Overall my experience at the dorms was positive, however there were some slight issues I had. The heating system was unreliable, being too cold in winter and too hot in summer. Moving heavy objects to the upper floors was difficult since there were no elevators. However, the staff and residents were all friendly and helpful, so my issues were few and far between.There are plenty of off-campus housing to choose from. However, they are either expensive or poor conditions.The off campus dining options are limited. There are the typical McDonald\\'s and other fast food places but that is really it.Living on campus has been great for me. The dorms are good depending on which dorm you choose to live in and the residents are very nice. The best option for dorms would be the newest dorm building, Vandergriff, which was built two years before. The worse option would be Lipscomb which is a very old building that has had mold problems in the past. All of the dorms have a amenities and good social atmospheres. The prices are reasonable. You definitely pay for what you get. All of t he dorms are extremely convenient. Most of the dorms are in the center of campus or just a little ways off.Campus strictness is average on my campus.The safety and security on campus is the best I have seen. At night, I see police driving around constantly making sure that people are safe. The police even have a once a week dinner in the Campus Cafe for students to ask questions about anything they would like to know. All of the buildings require a swipe card after hours.The only meal plan offered is to the Campus Cafe and there is a little diversity but the meals are often repeated on weekly bases. The food quality ranges from decent to good depending on which chef is in the kitchen. The value is a little high but it is doable. The meal plan is swipes or you can use Dine in Dollars to eat in the Plaza. You are given a limited amount of Dine in Dollars depending on which meal plan you purchase. The plaza has good food such as Panda Express, Subway, Sushi, and Chick-fil-a. The final opinion to use your Dine in Dollars is in the Market. They sell easy to eat food and school supplies.My campus is extremely diverse and completely accepting. We have a wide range of races, sexuality, and religions and no one judges them. There a open clubs for just about anything. There has been a week where Christians set up a prayer tent and then the next week Muslims are playing prayer music. There have been political stances shown openly on campus where both sides express their opinions. The campus overall is extremely accepting and understandable.The academic level at my college is good. The professors are easy to reach and they teach very well. They are easily approachable and are willing to help when a student needs it. The curriculum in most of my classes have been the average information that students learn. The most popular study area for people on campus is the library. It is six floors of great study areas. There are also some good study programs that are available to the students.Being an education major on my campus is great. There are not many education majors on the campus so it is easy to get to know the advisers, the education professors, and I am not competing against that many students to get into the program. So far the workload has been fairly easy but I am expecting it to get hard as I continue in the program.My experience at school has been amazing. I have made amazing friends that I know will be in my life for a long time and have had a lot of fun. My school has room for all sorts of people that you kind find people who are greeks or all the way to the cosplayers and D&D nerds. There really is a group of people for everyone to hang out with. I would choose my school again in a heart beat because no matter what there is a place that anyone can fit into.The Greek life on campus is the main social hub on campus. If you are in a greek house then you know all about the upcoming social events and gossip that floats around campus. The greeks are nice students who do not let the fact that they are greek keep them from socializing with the non-greek. The greek students are viewed as the cool kids by the non-greeks. The greeks, however, do not have specific housing for them but they do have houses for meetings.The teachers and faculty are very nice and helpful. It is very diverse and you have a great opportunity to make friends.Bachelor of Fine Arts Design Program is Top Notch!  I\\'m a Rhode Island School of Design Scholarship winner with EASY entry into any USA top Fine Arts Schools after getting the AP studio portfolio coveted 5.  UTA hires unexpected & top notch working professionals including Award Winning Advertising Creatives.  They are easy going in class without the portfolio reviews of North Texas.  But IF you work to get the A, you walk out with an impressive original student portfolio that impresses the Pros.  What you get out of it is based on your personal effort but guided by Pros.  Spending 6-12 additional studio hours weekly is expected to earn an A.  C & D Design students are earning a \"fun\" degree but looking toward a Professional Football Career or a non-related Job Promotion.  The Campus is lovely with architectural tiers reminiscent of Mountain architecture.  Architecture & Glass Blowing programs are great too!UTA is a good place to receive your college education. The faculty and staff on campus are fully dedicated to helping their students. While they expect the best out of them and don\\'t take it easy on them, they do their best to help them succeed in their classes. It wouldn\\'t hurt to upgrade some of their buildings and add extra parking, but they are beginning to take the necessary steps to accomplish those thingsIt has an amazing atmosphere, people, and location. If you want to experience a wonderful journey then the University of Texas Arlington is the perfect choice.I like that the instructors were relatable, and the dean of the program was always available for a meeting. The campus is close and centralized enough for commuting from FTW. The campus also has a lot of valuable resources for their students including gyms, health clinics, and tutors!This campus is uniquely diverse and I believe that is one of UTA\\'s best qualities. They accept and allow all sorts of different people and I presume that this fact helps a student\\'s learning abilities because it exposes them to all sorts of cultures. Also the professors are very interactive in the classroom during lecture, which improves a students\\' success. The only aspect I would change about this school is to increase its priority to more than just their engineering programs, for a college to flourish all programs should be showcased equally. Yes the highlight of UTA is their nursing and engineering programs, but their music program is widely talented and should be benefited more, also education and business those are the most important jobs to handle besides being an engineer or a nurse. But all in all, I\\'m really enjoying my first year of being in college, and I like the calm, modern, technologically advanced, atmosphere that UTA has given to me.Professors here are great and down to earth (most of them). Books from the campus bookstore cost a lot, but Chegg.com is a lifesaver. UTA places a heavy emphasis on diversity, but even more so on acceptance. KINE department is wonderful. I am glad that there is not a football team so the other sports don\\'t get swept under the rug. I LOVE that there are wheelchair basketball teams here! So many great opportunities!I am currently enrolled in the RN to BSN online program. It is a lot of work but has been manageable so far for this busy mom and nurse.I was a dual credit student part of the honors academy. The ladies working there took great care of me and my needs. The professors I had were not that great.The University is growing mainly in engineering which is great but it feels as if they\\'re forgetting about the other majors. Foe example, I\\'m in geology and my department lacks in lab equipment and even professors. We just don\\'t have enough of them.It is very easy to get to through public transportation and there is always something happening at campus. nThe professors are my favorite part of the university. They are very professional and interact with the students in a way that makes us feel at ease when joining in the class discussions.My experience here at the University of Texas at Arlington has been a really  good one.  I have learned so much more about my area of study and I have also enjoyed all of my professors and their classes.  I feel like the academics here are very challenging, but so well worth it.  There are a lot of student organizations and activities to get involved in on or around the campus.University of Texas at Arlington is a great school. This university is a filled with many diverse cultures and will give you the opportunity to experience those many cultures. Very friendly environment and tuition will not cost as high as other schools.The area around Arlington campus is trying to improve but there is constantly construction somewhere. This is not a party school.What I liked about the University of Texas at Arlington was the staff was very helpful and supportive to the students. In order for each student to be successful in the courses you take. There are teachers assistants that are ready and available if you need extra help and tutoring. There are computer labs available if you need to complete your homework on campus. It had a lot of amenities available to be a successful student.It seems like a great school that can be a place for many different degrees and it affordable to other like colleges.I have enjoyed acquiring my degree from UTA. Some courses are more difficult than others and have been a struggle, but the reward of hard work becomes all the more satisfying. I have become a better writer, thinker, and have grown much from my experiences and connections at UTA. It is reasonably priced compared to other schools and they offer good financial aid. As a Kinesiology student, the gym is fabulous and my degree-specific classes have not been disappointing. Each course towards my degree makes me more and more excited for my future as an athletic trainer.UTA has a lot to offer. From the various student organization to the networking it provides through the career development center, there is always some sort of resource to expand on your education. UTA is at the center of a slowly but surely growing Downtown Arlington.Attending the University of Texas at Arlington has been one of he best experiences of my life. The best quality is the amount of diversity that you can experience while being there. You can meet people from all over the world and learn so much about them. So much growth takes place and I truly wish everyone could experience what is it like to attend this University.So far I love everything about UTA the classes are great and there are always events going on. The food from the connection cafe is great and I love how once in a while they do a Hawaiian themed lunch which is a great change from the usual lunch choices. I also like how one can fall asleep pretty much anywhere outdoors and nobody seems to care. Another thing that I like about UTA is that the professors are very kind and understanding and always try to help in the best way possible. When it comes to financial aid UTA does a pretty good job in helping its students get the help they need they give you a variety of options to help you get the money that you need. They also have plenty of on campus jobs that students can apply for.n When it comes to the classes I\\'ve only attended for a semester, however, the general class size is around 30-40 students which aren\\'t too bad compared to other universities. All in all it\\'s a great university to attend.In order to get into the education program you have to first take the THEA test. Then you must apply to the program and go to a seminar. The most important criteria for getting in is making sure you have the GPA. The best tip for getting into the program is just work hard in your core classes and just keep working at it.The education program on my campus is amazing. The advisers are always so helpful and able to answer any question that is asked. The program overall is the best choice I have made. The program is definitely helping me to be prepared for the when I am finally in a class teaching. The only concern I have is about finding a good job in the area I plan to live in after college.The students at my college are all pretty nice. They are mostly wearing polo shirts, sagging jeans, and the newest tennis shoes out there. Most are into supporting out basketball team no matter what. For the most part, everyone is friendly on campus and easy to get along with.when its a class over my major, the workload does not bother me so muchI think that a relationship with the professors is importantI have had a good experiencethere is diversity In every aspectmaybe should be a little more strictits a lot like any other college, I live at home so ill not that involvedgreek life is mainly linked with partiesfacilities are good, campus is a good sizeI am a mature adult student who lives off campus.  I have enjoyed attending school because most of the professors are excellent, the students are very diverse and come from many parts of the globe.  If I were in my late teens or early twenties I would join one of the many clubs and live on campus to fully enjoy the college experience.I was able to apply for financial aid and several scholarships online.  However, I suggest that students visit the financial aid office a few times during the school year to pick up scholarship applications of local organizations that do not offer online applications.Since I transferred to UTA from the local community college, the registration process was fairly easy because they have transfer agreements with UTA and all my core classes transferred easily. Most of the education professors are excellent and the workload is reasonable.The College of Education fully prepares teacher candidates to pass the certifications tests.  UTA has partnerships with the local school districts so that teacher candidates can observe classrooms and complete the student teaching requirements to obtain their degree and teacher certifications.UTA is located between Dallas and Fort Worth.  Since public transportation is limited in Arlington, a car is very helpful to get to the many attractions, activities, cultural events, shopping, and sporting events in the area. The area welcomes students.To get into the education program teacher candidates must have a 3.0 GPA prior to entering their junior year.  They must also take a THEA test and pass with above average scores.  Take advantage of resources such as the writing center and math tutors to help you make the grades. Use study guides to help you pass the THEA.I am studying to become an elementary school teacher with a certification in English as a Second Language.  I feel that UTA is helping to fully prepare me for this career.  With this certification I feel certain that I will be able to find a job.I feel relatively safe on campus due to the visibility of police and security officers.  However there have been several reports this semester of robberies and attempted robberies of mobile phones.  Most of these occurred in the evening or overnight when students were walking alone.If you get caught, it\\'s BADEngineering is awesome. Not many activities thoughEngineering, Arch and Business are best.Getting through orientation as freshman sucksNobody really cares. Except for BasketballIt\\'s Texas. One day it snows, next day 90 degrees.20 mins from Dallas. Sports galore. and Mall.Escorts available. Not 100% safe though.None yet. Plan on it thoughDifficulty is there for sure.Everything is packed at lunch time. BewareFor a small school, there are big opportunitiesEh pizza, burgers, asian. About itSometimes money goes missing for a LONG timeI think we\\'re all okay?Everyone knows where to get liquor if wantedThe workload is sometimes heavy, but it\\'s to be expected, however with job opportunities it seems that you\\'re left on your own to find them.So far I\\'ve had mostly great professors. In terms of studying, the floors above the second one are excellent.From what I\\'ve seen, they are strict on things that need to be watched out for, otherwise they are lenient, which is fine.The buses that transport people around campus are great, however the wait time for some of them can be terrible.They are very prominent when asking new students to rush, however, after that if you don\\'t know many of those involved, you don\\'t really hear anything about it.For the most part everyone seems to be sociable, however at times even saying hi to a girl you don\\'t know seems to cause them to be a bit annoyed.Our engineering department is is apparently one of the best, if not the best in the country from what I\\'ve been told and seen.I\\'m on the billiards team and so I\\'m usually in the MAC, and the MAC is generally a nice place to hang out after class.The prospect of med school is great, however if I could redo it, I\\'d choose a course with a backup plan, or with more options in terms of employment.Since my program was biology, I didn\\'t really have to do anything after admission into college.The ones I\\'ve visited seem to be alright.I\\'ve met some great people, but I feel like there is more that I can do to actually enjoy my time there to the fullest.I bring my own laptop to school, but it\\'s nice to have some computers immediately available for use when I\\'m in a hurry.Support for the varsity teams on campus is slowly increasing with changes to how they are organized, which is great.There\\'s a lot of food options, however sometimes it tastes bland.From what I have heard, the UT Arlington basketball teams receive the most support. However, it is not widely supported, and neither are the other sports we have. I have rarely seen or heard anything of our intramural teams. Usually the most popular sport and source of school spirit on a campus is the campus\\'s football team, but UTA does not have one.Texas weather is known for being extreme. I have gone to class during all types of weather. The only problem I have with the weather is when I drive to and from school and then walk to class, but the weather is okay as long as you properly prepare for the day.UT Arlington is an average school. I was initially an English major, a program that I did not enjoy. However, I really love the Journalism program, which I am currently enrolled in. UTA is mostly known for its nursing program, which is staffed with excellent teachers. The school has a library, which is a great place for studying, and a new gym called the MAC, a great place to work out at. However, I do not believe I would choose this school again because of the English program.I have not eaten at any restaurants off-campus; I usually only eat at the on-campus cafeteria. However, from what I have learned from reviews online and friends, the restaurants serve decent food for a high price.The Journalism program at UT Arlington is great! All of the teachers I have had have been extremely knowledgable about everything from sentence structure to AP style and have been available outside of class to answer questions. However, the teachers are difficult and give a big workload.I have been a UT Arlington student for two years now, and I have never felt any threats or issues to my health or safety. Police could be more present on campus, but they definitely do their part to keep students, faculty and staff safe while on campus.UT Arlington has an excellent nursing program, and has many excellent staff and teachers available. Many students at UTA are enrolled in the nursing program. All other programs are mediocre, neither being excellent nor horrible.I did not enjoy life as an English major at UT Arlington. My teachers never made it clear what the criteria for assignments were, graded work harshly and gave little explanation as to what mistakes were made. However, UTA\\'s Journalism program is excellent. The teachers I have had are all very knowledgable, helpful and reasonable. The English program offers a Writing Center on the 4th floor of the main library, while the Journalism program is home to The Shorthorn, the school newspaper.UT Arlington is a fairly safe campus. Campus police officers and students usually get along fairly well. Although officers are not always on patrol around campus. There is an on-campus station and an emergency, non-emergency number and several security posts where you can reach campus police by. Police are very strict, however, about parking, and a permit is required at all times.The math program was easy to get into but you have a lot of work to do to stay in it and it takes a lot of studying. Stay in study groups and go to tutoring. If you have a question always ask.I am happy with  my program, just must get involved more. If i could do it over again, I would switch my major and minor. My career goals are either be a teacher, start off at an high school AP teacher and mover up to an college professor, or work at Google, PlayStation, or Microsoft.Academics are good here, make sure you rate your professor your first two years. Now I will say after you start getting deeper into your major you will have not much control over class time and teacher because there will be one time  and one teacher offered for some important classes.Being a math major it is fun. I can go into different paths either be a teacher or back up my major with computer minor and go work at a business like Google.Police protrol all the time and UTA police are always there when you call.There are shuttle buses for on campus and they just got the mav express for train travel. Also there are mega buses around.So far I love UTA, its all about how you take on where you are at and how involved you get.Financial aid process is all about how you handle it and how efficient you are with doing it on time.There are off campus apartments right next to campus and they are advertise on campus. Some are furnished and some are not. Pro is you will have more money without having to pay for a meal plan, con space is limited and goes fast.The athletics program is doing an uprising since UTA is so academically known, they tend to oversee the athletics but its is on a rise.I love Arlington, my aunt lives here and every summer for two weeks while I was in high school I would come stay with her and my cousin, I enjoyed everyday. There is a lot to do here in Arlington: Six Flags, Hurricane Harbor, Parks Mall, MAC, and plenty of restaurants.There are a lot of unique things about UTA for the most part how diverse it is makes it so unique. There are different cultures living among each other and joining forces.Student life on campus is great, I love the Mac-which is the Mavericks Recreation Center. There are a lot of student involved events on campus and the library is going to be your home away from home. There is this awesome green space on the roof of the engineering building its beautiful.I\\'m not in the Greek life but I have friends who are and they say it is amazing. Also them being my friends I some what enjoy it also they do a lot of great things.UTA is an non smoking campus so not even cigarettes, they enforce drug and alcohol usage very well.The food is awesome on campus, personally I love chick-fil-a!On campus living is great for your first two years, I did it and meet some of my great friends I know now.At UTA there is something always going on, you just have to affiliate yourself with others and get involved.UTA is very diverse college and its awesome because they support everyone\\'s background and try to help other s understand also.It can be very pretty one day and gloomy the next but overall its okay nice weather.I do not live on campus, but from what I have heard, it seems pretty average. Although pricing is extremely high, students can choose from a variety of dorms, both old and fairly new. All of the housing options are in good locations on campus.There are many lots around campus available for student parking. The annual cost for a student car permit is $150, pricey but unavoidable if you need to drive to and from school every day. UTA cops are generous with handing out tickets and give fines of about $50 to those without a permit. Lots 49 and 50 are the best places to park, while lot 47 is only convenient if you arrive by 8 or 9 a.m. The streets Cooper and Matlock, the main streets that run through UTA, have many stoplights and are busy before and after elementary school and work hours, so I suggest planning accordingly. However, the parking lots are all conveniently located, so the walk to class is never a hassle.I\\'m actually not very familiar with off-campus housing, but I would assume that it is about average.UTA is still a small school. The school population is growing faster than the rate of facilities that are being established. But for their size UTA has a lot to offer and is only growing.This is a huge commuter school and although there are a lot of on campus activities not everyone participates. However, there are always large outcomes to events and there are active sororities and fraternities.All the parties are fun!Mine is international business (spanish) and minoring in accounting.Everyone is pretty chill and friendly.Most financial aid is completed online. Students can log into MyMav, where they can then view their financial aid, accept or decline awards and report other financial aid.All campus parties are open for all students. The biggest party on campus is The Bash, hosted in College Park Center featuring DJs and lights. There are several bars around campus for those of age, which have nice atmospheres and have a regular flow of student customers.I am not in a Greek sorority myself and have never tried to join. However, I have seen many Greek fraternity and sorority chapter booths around campus recruiting students, and there are always students on campus wearing their Greek chapter shirts.I have never used public transportation to get to or from UT Arlington. Most students, including myself, drive to and from school. Although the streets are somewhat crowded before and after work hours during the week and on the weekends, there is easy access to parking lots across campus. Taxis at UTA are rare.The only drug and alcohol use I have seen on campus would be at parties in dorms; otherwise, students are rarely seen smoking or drinking on campus.Dallas has several professional sports teams, and the most popular, the Texas Rangers and Cowboys, practice in stadiums right in Arlington. Downtown Arlington is very nice and has a variety of restaurants, food trucks and a small outdoor arena. There are also many restaurants, both fast food and dine-in, located around Arlington. For shopping, the Parks Mall is located right off IH-20 between Cooper and Matlock streets, and the Grand Prairie Outlet Mall is only ten minutes down the highway.I am not familiar with the campus meal plan dining hall, but the regular cafeteria in the University Center has many options, such as Subway, Chick-Fil-A, Pizza Hut and Panda Express. There is also another Asian food option and a variety of drinks and packaged foods. Around the corner is a mini grocery store for to-go snack foods. For those looking to satisfy their coffee cravings, there are several Starbucks on campus. There is also an Einstein Bros Bagels on the first floor of the Fine Arts building. Although all of these options are a little pricey and do not accept gift cards, the variety is quite nice.There are many places you can go on campus if you need to use a school computer. Computers are available in the UC, library, Maverick Activities Center, and in computer labs and classrooms in most buildings on campus. Although you might have a hard time finding a computer that has Adobe programs such as Photoshop, every computer I have used on campus has had basic functions such as access to the internet and Microsoft programs. The UTA network\\'s speed is average, and I would suggest investing in a personal computer rather than using school printers that cost to print.The students at UT Arlington are nice, eager to learn and social. Most students are young adults and look and dress about average. Students involved with organizations set up booths during the week in front of the library and both outside and inside the University Center. The library, UC and gym are where most students hang out at. While there are dorms on campus, most of the students who attend UT Arlington are commuters. This greatly effects the social life on campus.The alert system is fantastic. They text and email safety alertsThey allow a lot of political demonstrations which is kind of annoying to me.Compared to my previous experiences with financial aid at my former university, the process at my current university went a lot more smoothly. The campus understands that during the early parts of school semesters, that it is necessary extend office hours beyond normal working hours to provide any additional services to students.The students are very much involve in the baseball team.Study options allows each student the opportunity to study in the nursing labs, study as a group or study in the library.Strict rules are made and continuos monitoring is done to check on the illegal activities including drinking, smoking and taking drugs on-campusIt\\'s really great and life is enjoyable at this universityWe can find all kinds of PC\\'s and laptops including MAC and windows versions.rnrnWifi is of good speedrnrnPrinting costs around 4 cents per page and scanning is for freeEducation is always transforming here based on the requirements of the industries and to make students ready for the employment world and to face any challenges.There isn\\'t much during night unless you find someone to go hangout withThe police here are assisted by the city police in maintaining safety.rnrnThey are very helpful and everywhere booths are setup for emergenciesThere is very much to learn here. Some professors do research and we can assist them. This is of mutual benefit to us. Professors encourage us to get internships, jobs, presentation ceremonies.Though we can find many opportunities, the increasing number of students makes it hard for us to find one. Huge competition is there here.Having been in Texas, no one can forecast weather in this area.rnrnOne time sunny, once rainy and some time snowrnrnGreat twists, climate plans on usHere importance is given only to the talent, but not any kind of discriminationAs I am a veggie, I had to repeat a bunch of dishes each time I visit.rnrnBut for non-vegetarians you can find excellent variety of foods and the quality is also very good at an affordable price. We get some student discount also at select restaurants, this is the best partIf I reject a housing contract, then the housing department assumes I don\\'t want to live on-campus at all. This is stupid. If I reject the contract then that means I want to be notified when there is a better offer available.You have to know the right people or else there\\'s nothing to do on the weekends.If there are no events going on on-campus, then there are no events going on.The education is excellent, but the workload is ridiculous.You will meet all different shapes and sizes of people at UTA.The engineering student services isn\\'t the best, and the professors all have thick accents that are hard to understand, but it\\'s tolerable.You don\\'t really have to apply to get into the engineering department. Once you meet the requirements they automatically put you in.I personally have a meal plan on-campus, so I don\\'t eat out much, but there are so many different places I want to try! Almost all international students can find a slice of home in the cuisine near campus.Not enough students come out to the games.The only problem is that they do not have enough servers for all the computers to be logged on at once. You may find yourself waiting for up to 30 minutes if everyone is on computers that day.There are so many different restaurants available within a reasonable distance to UTA.I really don\\'t know. As I said before, I am a single mother who works and goes to school. I don\\'t have time for any of this. Also, I know that people who do drugs and so forth stay with people who do drugs. I\\'m never approached about them because I\\'m sure they see I\\'m not interested.I love the Social Work program! There are many clubs to join relating to my field. Also, since I am interested in the field I actually really enjoy my courses.I am in the Social Work program. The process is very simple to apply. If you\\'re not sure you can always ask an advisor or their assistant for help too.I haven\\'t attended a game yet for UTA. I have seen things being advertised though and heard fellow students talking about them.Summer time is HOT! It\\'s Texas. Spring is the best and Winter varies. Walking from class to class isn\\'t the greatest sometimes.Financial Aid was awarded in a timely manner. My classes were not dropped. Although, when I went in to the office to check on something the person that was helping me didn\\'t seem to know the answer but made something up. I had her go double check!I don\\'t live in a dorm so I\\'m not sure how life is living there. I don\\'t ever seem to have a problem with strictness though. I follow the rules and do what I\\'m supposed to do.Arlington is located in the middle of all kinds of sporting events. The AT&T stadium (Dallas Cowboys) and Globe Life Park (Rangers Stadium). There are also plenty of museums and libraries. The possibilities are endless.There are many different clubs for ethnic groups. My program is Social Work, where that is a key focus.I\\'m not Greek but it seems cool.I like living on campus. I am even moving into a new apartment this summer. Love it hereI like Arlington. Everything like dance studios, theaters, etc are within walking distance.The teachers take an interest in the lives of their students. They want everyone to learn and passThey are everywhere. Each building has its own lab and they run fast.Texas weather can be unpredictable!I have my own car, so I don\\'t need transportation.I lve on campus, so I don\\'t know much about the off campus housing.We have a large variety of restaurants to choose from on and off campus.I love my dorm, but it\\'s expensive when you don\\'t have many scholarships.Most students attend sporting events on campus.I filled out a FAFSA, but I didn\\'t qualify for anything except loans.I\\'m not really into Greek life, so I don\\'t know much about it.I\\'m not really around people who drink or do drugs.We have a lot of things to here, but studying is priority.I don\\'t mind rules. They keep us safe.I don\\'t party, so I don\\'t know.I don\\'t go to many sporting eventsTexas weather is always unpredictableI\\'m in the bachelor for biology/teaching and the program has small class loads and very personal.There are a lot of computer labs availableIt\\'s hard to find any scholarships for a person with my income statusEverybody is excepted here and the school gives help for low income peopleThere is a beautiful campus and everybody is very helpfulI haven\\'t started classes but the tour looked greatThere are many options of transportationThere are places to get free printing, as a college student, this will be to your benefit. Oh how I love this school for its technology, they are going to perk it up for 2015 so stay tuned.UTA is great for engineers and nursing students, these are the top study areas, nursing students, I (an engineering student) envy you, you have really cool equipment, that\\'s not to say UTA engineers have it bad bioengineering practically have our own NEW costly building, and I am loving the perks, honestly if you are studying engineering or nursing this is the school for you.Its very tranquil, and not very much like its sister school UT-austin (party school), UTA is calm, and one hardly has parties, there are though stuff to do at nights like the movies they play, pretty cool hangout oh and they have concerts too.You literally are warned about drugs, before you even go, you should know better, drugs and what not are strictly forbidden.This is what UTA is known for DIVERSITY! it is absolutely awesome meeting people from different backgrounds, one learns alot, and it\\'s really great.There are more and more ways of transportation on campus, recently the max opened and it connects cities from fort worth to dallas and everything in between, including uta, also its I think $1 for UTA students either one or four don\\'t remember.Sometimes it gets a bit cold or rainy especially during the winter, but there are ways to get to class without having to be outside too much, usually you can tell there will be bad weather if no one is walking outside of the library.Haven\\'t been to any sporting events, but from what I have heard they are pretty good.Greek life is not big or small at UTA. There are a bit of each type of sorority and fraternity any student is looking for. I\\'m not in a sorority but plan to rush soon. From what I\\'ve observed, the sororities look like they have a lot of fun and enjoy helping each other and the community. There are four PHC sororities but don\\'t let that small number fool you. The girls are sweet and kind. On any ordinary day you\\'ll see all the Greeks wearing their letters on campus. UTA has PHC IFC NPHC and MGC. The PHC and IFC are kind of the only ones that have houses and they\\'re located on Greek Row which is near the MAC. If you\\'re interested in going Greek I strongly advice you to go for it. Do your research first to make sure it\\'s for you and then go for it.This is Texas. If you\\'re not from Texas then you may have a problem with the weather. I\\'m from Houston so I totally understand this crazy weather. One day it\\'ll be hot and sunny and then the next day you\\'ll have to pull out the boots. Texas weather is bipolar and that\\'s the truth. It gets really cold during the end of the year and the beginning. We\\'ve received a heavy amount of sleet/snow and have had classes canceled.  After awhile the weather evens out and becomes somewhat normal. My only advice is to have a weather app. I check mine every morning before I get dressed. You cant just look out the window and just guess what the weather will be like. You have to check your weather app. Also invest in some winter gear (jackets boots etc) you\\'ll definitely need them around December.If you live on campus, most dorms have computer labs in them but they don\\'t have printers. If you need to print either bring your own or go to the library or the second floor of the UC to print. You\\'ll have to put money on your MAV ID to print but it\\'s only 4 cents a print which is way cheaper then buying your own printer. I put 20 dollars on my card for a semester and a half and I still haven\\'t used it all. If you must have a printer in your room then that\\'s fine but in my opinion using the school\\'s printers are a good idea.rnrnI think having a laptop or your own desktop is highly needed at UTA. You\\'ll be using Blackboard a lot and its really inconvenient to run to the library every time you need to check your grades or do online homework assignment. Especially if its late at night and you forgot to do an assignment. The library does have computers (Apple Mac\\'s and a few Dell desktops). On weekdays the library is usually full but if you go when people are usually in class you should find a few available. The computers in the UC are all desktops and are not that busy.There are blue boxes for personal safety and a clinic on campusThe scholarships awarded are greatThe psychology program is awsome, I cannot speak for the other programsThe admission to UTA is straight forward and simple to get into a programIt\\'s a good aspect to protect studentsIts credited and encouraged by the housing departmentavaerage weather considering its TexasI do not really party, so I guess its averageThey work with charity and things like thatArlington is located between two bigger cities, Dallas and Ft Worth, so there\\'s plenty to do in those two cities. Arlington is kind of boring thoughNot sure how to rate this one? I mean the alcohol and drugs are there if you want to partake, but no one is forcing anyone toIt\\'s Arlington, TX so there\\'s very little public transportation. Most people I know have cars. Traffic sucks bad thoughCampus Conduct policy can be pretty overbearring at times. Once got in trouble for having empty smirnoff bottles in my dorm room.I\\'ve used their services many times and have been generally pleased with the experienceFaculty I\\'ve had are actually pretty cool. No one I\\'ve had was too left or right in their teaching methods, thought some are, but I stay away from their classesReceived my scholarship, but they took it away because I\\'m interning out of state. :(Wifi is pretty good. Computer labs are unused by most considering everyone has their own laptopNot the best it could be, but if you want a social life at UTA, you should go greekMet some of my best friends through on campus housing so I can\\'t complain a tonIt\\'s Texas weather though so many people might not be able to handle itOur school doesn\\'t have a football team. Intermurals are big in greek lifeI love the program! I know I will get somewhere someday with it.I it\\'s raining outside, you have to walk through the rain to get to class.I bring my own laptop and get great signal.I don\\'t notice or pay attention to any of that.Greek life is great and supporting.I\\'m in class at night and immediately drive home afterwards.I save money and eat at home.I haven\\'t had any problems with financial aid.Do not live on campus.Not much support for our teams.I like the school a lot and the education you receive from there is a good one. It is definitely a commuter college so I find it hard to meet friends because a lot of the students are only there for school and not interested in building relationships. I do find it odd still that there is not a football team.The best thing I LIKED about the University of Texas at Arlington is the resources  and the involvement of those who are around you each and everyday. All of my Professors were extremely helpful and supportive.So far, my experience at UTA has been great. Student life has become interesting, I gotten to know a variety of people from different cultures. The clubs to join are fun and the activities to take part on. The instructors are great as well, they care for their students and do nothing but to push them out of their comfort zone and do their best.The advisers, at least the freshman ones, are horrible and have no idea what they\\'re doing. The honors one that I\\'ve delt with has been great, but my freshman adviser, Katy, was terrible. I had incoming credit from high school, and when it came in I had to completely change my schedule. They stuck me with a business adviser when I\\'m a nursing student! It completely ruined the order of my classes, and I\\'ve been left to figure out my own schedule. I came in to plan my second semester and she asked me what classes I\\'m taking! I\\'m worried that this will really screw over the rest of my college experience there. However, I\\'ve met some really good friends and everyone is so nice. Most of the professors have been good, and Honors College is cool to be part of. Campus is nice and has good facilities, and the dorms are very nice for what you pay. Overall, the school is a good deal for getting a nursing or engineering degree. Otherwise, I\\'d go somewhere else.My experience with UT Arlington so far has been amazing. I come from Lubbock Texas so it was a big change coming from a smaller city than the DFW area, but UT Arlington made my transition so much easier. Not to mention the professors here are even better than I imagined. If UT Arlington is on your list you should highly consider it!It has been a great experience so far. I have learned a lot in such a short time. I am pursuing nursing and hear great things about their nursing program. The faculty is very knowledgeable of the material and go out and beyond to help us students. Can\\'t see what these next 2 years hold.UTA is a great college. The campus is beautiful and the professors are well educated in their courses and willing to work with students.My semester at UTA was amazing. It is my freshman year and I was really scared about it. But the people at the university helped whenever I needed it. It was also amazing how many friends I made in such less time. Academically and socially I was always active. My grades improved over the semester and I went to a lot of events to keep myself busy and happy. It\\'s a nice place to make a career because you get a lot of opportunities to explore your options and decide a path.I love how the campus is cared for on the outside. The trees allow some sunlight in and the flowers are beautiful. It\\'s refreshing to come out of a classroom to admire the beauty of nature while you\\'re on campus for the day/night. I also feel comfortable here with all the other hardworking students.Not bad. Would love if more stuff would be going around in the campus. Some of the buildings are old. The faculty is nice and caring. My first year, and I wonder why some classes even exist.It sucks that they don\\'t have a football team, but the basketball team more than makes up for it.  The location makes it central to both Dallas AND Fort WorthI love this university. It has a diverse population and have met so many interesting people. My professors are great, and the classes are enjoyable. The campus is nice. There is a wide variety of food served for any meal. I am graduating in the spring.I went there a couple years ago when i was touring it. I loved the university overall, it offered a lot of majors to the students. Campus life is also great, the students are very friendly and welcoming. I loved it so much.I\\'m extremely proud and honored to be a student of university of Texas at Arlington for the fall\\'16. Being a freshman I experienced many new things at the university some were good and some were bad. Obviously the good comes first sonGood things : rich in diversitynMany organizations seeking your participation in eventsnEncouraging teaching staff.nBad things: around campus kind off not safe.nNot a good local area.nDorms having very small rooms (not worth the amount paid)nTill now I could gather this much only. Will update as soon as I  discovere new thingsUTA is a good school for nursing and engineering  intended majors. over rall the school is good but they could improve in some areas like food services and lab appliances used in classesAlthough I don\\'t attend UTA,  I have visited the campus with AVID before. This was an astonishing experience I encountered, due to the fact that its environment has showed me that it is a wonderful college to attend. In other words, it has bloomed my goal of attending the University of Texas Arlington.UTA is home to me. I love it there. The staff and the students are very friendly and are always there to help. The teachers always make it a point to be available and to help struggling students. The classes move at just the right pace, accommodating both the fast and slow learners. The libraries offer many resources and have plenty of computers for students to use. There are services like the math clinic that help students stay on top of their studies.nnThere are so many student organizations that a person cannot fail to be part of something. From cultural organizations to UNICEF, there is too much to do. There are many chances to do voluntary work with organizations like Circle K International. Friday nights are never dull. UTA offers many student activities from parties to movies.I like the fast that the University academic departments (i.e.colleges) have many majors per college so there were many options to consider, the staff are helpful land services are fairly wellSo far, it\\'s been pretty cool. I like the environment and the food places nearby. The classes have some pretty cool teachers.nI do hate parking, though. It\\'s terrible. And while the school has a lot of commuters, I don\\'t always feel like they accommodate commuting students all that much or make us feel very welcome. They\\'re putting forth an effort to change that though.I absolutely love UT Arlington. There are many ways to get involved on campus and take advantage of all the resources. UTA does a great job of building a sense of community and inclusiveness for all students.Haven\\'t had to deal with strict policies much.Most diverse school in the area.Admission was easy. Just put your program on the application and you get in.I have no fear about finding a job. The program is great, besides some pointless classes.I\\'ve never heard of off-campus housing.Workload is crazy and challenging.  There are plenty of internships an we are well know for our Engineering department.Safety is an issue, and you must have a vehicle to get anywhere.If you have no where to go during holidays be prepared to find other places to eat. The campus dining hall shuts down. There is very minimal housing. You need to apply early and check back often with campus housing. If you can get into the dorms they are very nice. Even the off campus apartments are routed through the school. Both usually have a wait list.If you are a first bachelor degree student then the financial aid department will bend over backwards to help you find money for school. If you already have a degree, then you are pretty much on your own. The different colleges have interdepartmental scholarships as well. There are people that will help you, but don\\'t wait until the last minute. The financial aid office is super busy. Go early.The classes offered at UTA transfer just about everywhere. The teachers are polite and helpful. I\\'ve never had a bad teacher. The classes are quite rigorous, so be prepared to study. Form study groups to lighten the load. For harder classes like chemistry, calculus, or biology an extra study session class is offered for free to help cement the learning from that week. If you are an off campus or online student there are just as many people willing to help you. There are many people who can conference online and via web chat when you need help. The librarians are very helpful and the writing center has been invaluable with papers and projects. Just make sure to book them way in advance of your due date.There are labs that are hidden that aren\\'t the main computer labs and library computers. There is always a technician in the room to help with computer problems. If you are in the arts the computer programs for design are top notch. They have an even distribution of Macs and PC\\'s given your taste. If you are invited to the honors college you get a computer lab with extra printing capabilities all to yourself. If you live in the dorms either buy your own printer and computer or get a jump drive and walk to the nearest computer lab.We have no football team, but we make up for it with men\\'s and women\\'s basketball. Go MAVS!Six Flags, Dallas Cowboys Stadium, Texas Rangers Stadium, Hawaiian Falls Water Park...need I say more? UTA is located in the middle of Dallas and Fort Worth and between the two major highways. If Arlington doesn\\'t have what you want, all you have to do is drive.The UTA college of nursing is very challenging and rewarding. I enjoy being among the elite students who are serious about completing their degree. It is fast paced and requires dedication. I wish that I was able to work and go to school, but the nursing degree requires a commitment to studying and attending classes only. UTA offers a 15 month program that is accelerated for students wanting to earn their BSN. The faculty is the best around and offer a unique perspective because they were nurses first before they were educators. UTA partners with many different hospitals around the metroplex, so if you want a job there are many hospitals that are already familiar with the caliber of UTA students and their work.All the upper level majors like engineering, nursing are pretty competitive. They have their own college policies and applications. The nursing program is tough to get into unless you are a great student at the top of your class. However, all the lower level classes are rigorous enough to prepare you for everything.If you are a commuter student it is hard to be involved in Greek life. If you go to school at night you don\\'t get to see the booths and fun activities that are held during the day.Most fast-food chains accept the meal plan card and your student ID is linked to a school bank account that is pre-loaded with money. You can use it like a debit card at surrounding restaurants. There is a little bit of everything around UTA. You just need to know where to look. It is also in the heart of Arlington. Great restaurants are just a drive away.Most of the students commute to school, so drugs and alcohol aren\\'t as prominent on this campus as others. There are seminars about awareness and counselors who are very present and always helpful if you have a problem. Arlington and UTA police work very well together to keep the campus safe.It\\'s in Arlington next to a jail...so...get a can of mace and keep your cell phone close. The UTA police are always present and available to get you to your car. The apartments that are \"off campus\" are within walking distance but fill up quickly. The closest apartments are about half a mile away and in a not so great neighborhood. Being that it is a commuter school you can live anywhere in the Ft. Worth/Dallas metroplex and drive to the campus.Texas weather is always fickle. You must always prepare for it to change. For the most part it is dry and hot, which allows for a lot of outdoor activities and fun!Its rewarding, but its a big hassle.There are plenty of computers available to the students, however most are in the central vicinity of the campus. If you wish to have a \\'social\\' aspect close to housing spaces, you should own a laptop. The wifi is free on almost all housing though.The school is sometimes closed due to weather, but nothing extremely out of the ordinary.There are quite a few restaurants in the area and enough variety to never tire of a small selection.I mostly spend the majority of my night time with close friends or at home.I believe the University of Texas at Arlington was rated one of the top 20 most diverse schools in the country based on US News article.I never feel threatened in the vicinity of the campus. Despite not having a \\'strong\\' presence at the university, the safety and health clinic both work to improve the school and do well at it.Classes are never a bother to get to, but the housing lacks a social environment.I have very little to no interaction with safety officers. I live off campusWhile there is no clear drug usage on campus I am sure that of the 30,000+ students that attend that some of them part take of drugs on campusTons of work and constant projects.There are people from all over the country and the world with differing view points and beliefsI do not really do things around campusI do not really attend or participate in sports or sporting eventsGo enough computers for general class workthe financial aid office is wonderful, with staff and work study students willing to help at the drop of a hat.  several financial aid options available, and very easy to apply forinstructors are incredibly knowledgeable and willing to offer help in and out of class to clarify ideas and questionsaside the from academic challenge of the program, the opportunities offered post graduation or much greater than what a simple business degree can offerthere is plenty of entertainment options near by, from fort worth stockyards to downtown dallas, there is never a need to drive more than 30 minutes to find a new exciting venue each weekthere is wifi in every building with decent connection speed.  there are several computer labs across campus from those that are designated for specific majors in their respective research buildings to general use plus an ample selection in the libraryhousing for off-campus students is somewhat limited.  there are plenty of different apartment locations, but they are all very similar, older properties.  they know you have little other choice than them and so they don\\'t feel they have to try too hard to entice you to stayClean housing, very affordable and convenient for travel to and from classes even in inclement weather, very friendly staff and diverse array of residentsTexas weather at its finest! Warm except for a bit of ice in the winter, which equals January alone.Arlington and the Dallas/Fort Worth area is full of opportunity and events!I received several excellent academic scholarships for being a transfer student!Off-campus dining options are endless since the area is extremely diverse!I do not have personal experience with the off-campus housing, but everyone I know who lives off campus says it is wonderful, except for the commuter parking!There is a bus which shuttles students around campus, but they could greatly benefit from more public transportation from campus to the surrounding area.Awesome faculty overall. Especially for communication students, the internships and opportunities are endless.I love living in Arlington Hall on campus! The only annoying thing is the meal plan requirement, but everything else is awesome.Student involvement is okay, but school spirit and the support of the general student body has huge room for improvement.I love the public relations program at UTA! The majority of the professors will challenge you, while still providing the assistance you need to succeed. Each individual really decides how hard they will or will not work to attain their degree, and the program overall seems to accommodate everyone\\'s different aspirations. I personally want to go into political public relations, hopefully planning political campaigns. This field tends to have a wide diversity of career options, broader than the specific area I aspire to most, so I\\'m looking forward to whatever I find when I do get into a long-term career!Admissions office is extremely helpful and it really isn\\'t very difficult to get into this program.There are a lot of off-campus housing optionsThey are very helpful with anything you may needThere are plenty of computer labs and wifi if you want to use your own laptopGreek Life has many events and parties to try to get people more involved.Not very many people doing drugs.There are a lot of food places, a mall, stadiums, and six flags near by.UTA is very diverse. There are people from all over the place here and everyone is friendly and treated equally.The major advisors are very helpful and the professors are nice and friendly.There are many groups for social work majors so you become very involved in the school and community. It\\'s a great way to meet new people and better understand your profession.I don\\'t play sports but, I love going to the MAC! (Mavericks Activities Center)There\\'s not very many parties. It\\'s not a party school so any parties would be on Greek row.I wish there were more financial aid possibilities.nothing really attractive to those who have lived here their entire lifeNumerous options for off-campus dining. Many give student discountsParking stickers are required which makes it difficult when you take a different car to school because your original  car is in the shopNew off-campus apartments, yet are extremely expensiveBeing greek does not effect the way non-greeks interact but one can see that greeks gravitate toward fellow greeksRain is the most annoying because despite the use of an umbrella, you still get wet.It would be nice if public transportation is available for those who live off campus, yet relatively close.Work load depends on major. english department could use an updated buidingcost of printing could be free considering the amount of tuition students payno one is really into the sports teams but the MAC is really nice and intramurals are definitely really fun!its usually really windy which bothers me because its hard to run in, but other than that its beautiful most of the timeI love the local places to eat here, even though everything else in Arlington is kind of awful at least the food in unique and delicious. I love Babe\\'s Chicken and I LOVE Nizza PizzaMost apartment complexes are run down and if not too expensiveMoney is always great no matter what it took to get it!Arlington is ghetto and sucks.very small, not like other universitiesI\\'ve never seen anyone drunk or high near me so thats goodHard to get into the classes you need when registration comes around. Professors aren\\'t that great for your major science courses.I want to be a nurse so bad but UTA creates a lot of obstaclesThe computers are kind of old and outdated and you have to know how to use microsoft software.I live on campus so I don\\'t really know..I\\'ve never personally been in trouble for anything but people are always getting parking tickets.It sucks to walk to class in the rain.Bring your own laptop. It is so much easier.I feel safe on campus and the police send out messages if something is wrong.If you obey the rules you won\\'t have any problems.School is near Ranger\\'s Ballpark and Cowboy\\'s Stadium. They are plenty of activities around campus, including games.I had a little trouble, but everyone was nice and helped me with the problem.Jack in the Box is good.There\\'s no peer pressure that I\\'ve seen with drug use, but the alcohol available to underage drinkers is a major event. Almost any fraternity party doesn\\'t check age for being able to drink.There\\'s tons of places right off campus to find great food for cheap, offering many options when food at school becomes mundane.I\\'m a white, middle class female and receiving financial aid is difficult. I was lucky to get any loans.As far as the health center goes, I don\\'t have much experience in dealing with them, but the safety of UT Arlington is actually an issue I have. The campus police are wonderful in offering services to make sure the students here don\\'t wander campus at night alone, but off campus there have been shootings, there have been muggings on campus, and recently some sexual assault issues have been brought up.Near two large cities has two major professional sports arenas nearby, there\\'s a mall not far south of campus, the parking lots/garages are on the outskirts of campus so there\\'s not many cars in the middle of campus for students to dodge, centrally located for access from the DFW metroplex, not the safest but not the most dangerous location.Theres not much to do except partying. Thats about it. And maybe going to target or walmart.They have a lot of rules but they understand that we\\'re adults and it\\'s college.Its Arlington. Come on, its pretty much a ghetto city with the Cowboys stadium and the university its crutches.Im gonna be honest, this school is great, but the city of Arlington is ghetto. You can meet some shady people if you go off campus and there are a lot of people stealing iphones for some reason. If its night and youre not walking with at least 3 people (including you) then call the campus police escortThe commuters at school are great. They have macs and dell computers if you\\'re interested in that, and there are quite a bit of computer labs all throughout campus. The printing on campus is cheap, but they only provide those at the library. The one problem I have an issue with is the wifi. The campus wifi is great but only available in the building on campus. The personal wifi, I think its Resnet or Apogee, is crappy. You\\'d think we would have at least have the commercial wifi grade available to on campus resident but no.They are always offering help meetings to write resumes. They also have a lot of job fairs and internship fairs.I really enjoy being in the business department. There are a lot of groups to join, and they offer great scholarships to business students.I have not had any trouble getting into the business department and the advisers ave very friendly.Arlington is a good city but I would much rather live in my home town.I have to walk a long way from my car to the classes so if it is raining or cold it is not comfortable. I also have to drive a long way to school which makes road conditions very important to me as well.I really enjoy watching and seeing our campus succeed in sports.I have never seen it used an smoking is banned from the campus. I have heard people talking about it.During the daylight times I feel safe at night it feels dangerous and wondering if someone is going to take something from you. There are also a lot of rundown apartments by the campus.I do not live on campus and I haven\\'t really heard a lot about the dorms.The great thing about Arlington is that it\\'s right in between Dallas and Fort Worth, two cities with lots to do! Arlington itself doesn\\'t have a whole lot of out-of-the-ordinary things to offer but it doesn\\'t have Rangers Baseball and Dallas Cowboys stadiums. Lots of sports activities are available to attend at the University, if you\\'re into that sort of thing. Everyone here is really friendly and I have never gotten any negative attitudes towards me because I am a UTA student.The website to register for classes is extremely difficult to navigate because when you click on a link it opens up additional windows where you have to again log on to the website. The professors, for the most part, have been very helpful and the workload for the course have been very manageable for a student who works full-time.There is a large diversity of students of various ethnic backgrounds. Texas is known as the melting pot after all.landlord was reasonable as long as I kept up the houseI live near Dallas and Fort WorthI like it warm!!! I hate the cold!!!!Not as big as state campuses, but pretty popular for the smaller school.WiFi everywhere, and every \"hangout\" spot has computers to use.No football team, hopefully soon to come back. The MAC is a wonderful facility, and I can\\'t get enough of it. The Varsity sports present are indeed great, though.Many great programs and also new President refurbishing programs that have dropped in rank recently. Nice to see.Great to have so many different people surrounding you. Learning about different cultures and religions is much more fun and easy when you hear personal experience.Good food, and cost as much as a meal at Chili\\'s give or take. Many options as well.Campus police are very present on campus.You won\\'t find any trace of drugs on campus.Great houses on campus, looked up to by many non Greeks.UTA is one of the most diverse colleges in America.The academic program for engineering is excellent.Police really crack down on drugs and drinking here.Campus shuttles and buses to the airport are great!If someone wanted to use drugs or take part in underage drinking or anything like that, they probably could. The campus isn\\'t riddled with drugs and alcohol, but you know it\\'s there. Not a huge deal, though.You can bring you laptop almost anywhere on the UTA campus. The internet connection is very reliable. When every it does go out, an email is sent to all students letting us know when and for how long we\\'ll be disconnected. It\\'s also a distraction! :)It\\'s much easier to go the classes and have a social life when you live right there with everything.The teachers are great for the most part (www.ratemyprofessor.com doesn\\'t lie). The Nursing and Engineering programs are probably what UTA is know best for. The Study Abroad program is really good, as well. The workload depends on your degree plan and your work ethic. The registration process is fairly easy as long as you stay on your advisor about getting everything together.It\\'s relatively safe. Of course there are dangers, but it\\'s nothing too out of the ordinary. The main thing would be the Police Escort Services not running on the weekends when most of the drama happens.It\\'s busy outside of campus, but you don\\'t know unless you look. Most locals are nice towards students and understanding of the life of a college student. There are two sports stadiums near campus, but it doesn\\'t affect student life much. The mall isn\\'t too far away and there is a bus route that goes everywhere.I think Greek Life is really cool. They all seem like genuinely nice people. I also like that at UTA, there is a Greek Lettered Organization for all ethnicities. It\\'s really nice to see.I\\'m an International Business - French major. I love the courses I have to take; lots of math and French, very little science beyond the basic prerequisites to graduate. I plan on starting my own business either in the fashion industry or something that helps children, or both!There are a lot of thing available, you just have to be proactive and ask about them and look for them, because people aren\\'t going to tell you.UTA is super diverse. There are all kinds of people everywhere and I love it!They are all mostly the same. The defining factor is usually the prices.Overall, my school does more than excellent job at handling electronic needs.For the most part, I do believe everyone here in accepting.Dining options around the campus are very accessible with proper knowledge.I couldn\\'t agree more that this program is very fit for me.The application process was very understandable and I was squared away in no time.The nice thing is you are not that far from Downtown Dallas or Downtown Ft. Worth.  So if things aren\\'t poppin off in Arlington, you can check out Dallas or Ft. Worth depending upon what you\\'re into.The classes were really enjoyable and being in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex, you have a wealth of internship opportunities in the #5 media market in the country.Most of the faculty are PhDs and they are tenured and published so you have the opportunity to learn from subject matter experts.  You will get out of it what you put into it.There have been a lot of new additions to off campus housing, making it easy and affordable for students to live off campus.Most restaurants are close to campus and they cater to the student body there because that is their lifeline for their business.Its chilly and cool to roam aroundNever tried going on them but heard that they are okayIts going well and everything is nice around meThey could really put a few places on the west-side of campus (currently the only option is a bagel place). For those of us that have our classes on the west-side of campus it can be a bit of a walk to the food options on the east-side of campus. Some of the buildings have been updated and are nice, however there are others that could very badly use some updating. The grounds keepers are always hard at work keeping the grass neatly trimmed, sidewalks cleared, etc. They could use some food places on the west-side of campus, the only option really is Einsteins, everything else is a bit of a walk. The landscaping is well taken care of. The Fine Arts Library could use a few more tables for students to work at. The MAC is great. Probably would have gone to a different school that was smaller, and less traffic. I come from a smaller town, and it has been a little overwhelming at times. Plus had I gone to a different school I would have graduated sooner; going here pushed my graduation back by a year and a half. There are not enough parking spots for our rapidly growing student population, so thankfully I live close enough off campus to walk/bike to school. However if you do need to park you better get there before 10:00 classes start otherwise you wont find a spot till later in the afternoon. The campus police are constantly patroling and writing tickets for cars parked in non-parking areas or without parking passes. There are a lot of choices between fast-food and regular sit-down places. Italian, Indian, Asian, pizza places, and bars. Definately recommend Pizza and Suds. Some places have student discounts with your student id, but not many. Rain makes the walkways extremely slippery and there tend to be lots of big puddles. If there is a lot of ice they tend to cancel classes. Dont live on campus, so I can only say really that they do enforce parking stickers and do not tolerate cheatingPlenty of computer areas, and for the most part there is wifi all over campus.We do have a lot of crime reports. Plenty of shopping. 5 miles from the Cowboys Stadium, Rangers Stadium, and 6 FlagsIt is close enough to the city where you can get away easily. There are many stores around that are convenient for students.Right amount of rules to be followed.UTA provides a wonderful shuttle program, helping students get to their classes and then back to their cars. The only problem is that there doesn\\'t seem to be enough shuttles.Here in Texas the weather changes constantly. In the morning you have to bundle up and in the afternoon you\\'re sweating. My classes are all in different buildings currently, so trekking out in the cold to my next class is almost unbearable sometimes as parts of the campus act as wind tunnels, only making matters worse.The University of Texas at Arlington is the only four year university I have attended. That being said, it is difficult to judge how it compares to other universities. However, I am having a wonderful time here at UTA and it\\'s wonderful engineering program and student organizations such as the AeroMavs club which builds a rocket to compete against other colleges across the nation every year and won first in the target altitude and planetary rover events last year.They have a lot of new restaurants that you can choose from if you want to try something new and exciting. The restaurants are fun and fresh and new for college students.Uta definately lets you know of all of the study sessions and si leaders in every class if you need help. I feel that  you have some great professors and the registration process is good. The workload is what you make it unless you are a financial student and have to be full time but that is only four classes and very doable if you have a good work/study ethic.Sociology is cool and laid back as long as you attend class regularly you will get the full experience and understanding of the topics presented in class. The curriculum is laid out in a very good and understable way. The program is easy and they help to get you to graduation.I had a smooth ride getting my financial aid and loans.Its okay, but i think that they should have a shuttle to take students with a family places off campus.I think the school is okay and people dress nice. People tend to hang with people they know.Its not that noticeable to me because I live off campusnot very good with scholarshipIt\\'s proximity with dallas and fort worth set it a part from other school. I can still have great opportunities for jobs but at the same time i can have a school town feeling within arlingtonit\\'s On all the time, students have activities and gathering in school all the time . it\\'s a very active school. I Love it!it\\'s great - I have seen people from variety of ethnicity so I am impressed how melting pot it isWell I feel very safe in the campus with campus police cars on the road all the time.It\\'s OK buildings seems very old but well maintained. not a pleasure experienceIt\\'s OK just a regular school with student tricks to manage drugs and alcoholSo far my classes, teachers and assignments are industry standards and that\\'s what companies are looking for in a graduate studentI am doing MIS and Information systems in my school is one of the best in state with very unique and industry leveled courses offeredThe apartments are not that great in condition but proximity is very close. you don\\'t have to walk farI am not into games but so far the facilities is very sufficient for studentsthe weather is one of my reason i am going to UTA. best weather little harsh in june july. but awesome year longit\\'s a party school...and easily availableThe transportation availability is greatI love the strictness because it make university a better placeThe food service is very good - it is easily available with great variety.Of course college is difficult, but if you apply yourself and study, you\\'ll be fine. The professors like when you come to them and ask questions about a topic that you don\\'t understand. They are willing to go above and beyond to help educate you. Nursing school at UT Arlington is extremely competitive. Last semester, the first 50 students that got accepted into the nursing program had GPAs of 4.0. About 500 students apply and only 120 are accepted.The cities around Arlington are wonderful; there\\'s always something to do.I\\'ve never heard of anyone having problems with the campus police.The girls on campus get on my nerves most of the time.The hall that I live in is amazing. It is far away from the rest of campus, but it\\'s worth the private room.this college was better than I expected in some ways. This school is perfect if you are trying to get your degree and get out in the world. This isn\\'t big on school sprite and other things.University of Texas at Arlington is a beautiful campus. This school is full of diversity and community support. I wouldn\\'t change a thing about it. University of Texas at Arlington is perfect the way it is.The school is very diverse. I loved everything from the dorms, cafe, and gym. The school is a place for those not trying to go far for school. I went there for cheer camp and the people there made the experience so much fun. The University of Texas at Arlington has professors that care about their students. It makes a big difference. I dont believe I could go to another college and being exposed to professors who are genuine and that I can relate withWhen I visited the University of Texas at Arlington I loved my overall experience, it was quite pretty and interesting to see it. My experience was fun and I loved the campus I\\'m pretty interested in this school and may consider going to it.UTA has a very friendly and open environment that is very welcoming. It is known as one of the most diverse schools in the state of Texas and i feel because of that, you can meet new people from all over, have an excellent academic experience from well trained professionals, and also have many extra curricular activities open to you as a student.  My overall experience was amazing and with out a doubt i met the best people and teachers and created life long friendships!I love the diversity of UTA! It creates a very unique environment! I also like the variety of classes available for students and the research prestige of the school.Overall, I\\'ve had a great experience at the University of Texas at Arlington. It is a very diverse school and I love that because I enjoy being around people who are different than me and learning something new about other cultures every day. In my opinion, that is one of the best things about this college. You learn to feel comfortable and be open to all kinds of people, which is important. Furthermore, I\\'ve had a good experience with the teachers that I\\'ve had, as they have all been very knowledgeable and I have learned a lot from them. The only things I would improve are to be able to see professors before we choose our classes, as we often have to end up choosing to take a class without knowing who will teach it until a few days before. Also, I would add a football team if I could because I feel like the school spirit is often lacking, as we don\\'t have any team representing us in the college leagues. They have a great science department as well as a wonderful nursing program.  Lots of diversity among the student body and social events.What I first enjoyed about this school was the diversity, you get to meet different people from different places. theres alot of ameneties where students can  hang out. My favorite thing about the school is how diverse it is. Everyone is friendly and accepting. It makes you feel more at home. The school is great . It has amazing proffesors. I would like to see more opportunities around the community.I liked how the environment was very friendly and the university was amazing in general. I would not change anything about the college. I love how the University of Texas at Arlington allows you to be an individual. There is no pressure to \"fit in\" like high school. I also love how diverse it is. So many different people from all walks of life are always on campus. It is a commuting school so most people do not live on campus but you will always see people hanging out in the library or in the MAC. I also like the the professors are dedicated to providing a higher education. You get a better look at your degree and see how you will fit in to the field.  The advisors are also very helpful in finding the best plan for you and figuring it what course load you can handle at the time.I love UTA for it\\'s academics, student life, and diversity.College is not for everyone, but it is by far one of the best choices I have made in my life. I came into orientation a few weeks prior to the start expecting to just go to class, work, and study. I then met Beta Theta Pi at orientation. One thing I can say to make your college experience better is to get involved. It helps you make new friends, meet tons of new people, it might even help you get better jobs and internships. Beta opened many doors for me that would\\'ve been closed forever if I hadn\\'t met them. I know that when I graduate, my resume is going to look great because of them. Because of all the clubs and organizations I joined, because of all the community service hours I would\\'ve completed. They have made my 2 months of college so much better than that. I always have something to do, I always have people to talk to and hangout with. I love college and am enjoying every moment of it. The website allows for easy access to scholarships and general college information to all parties involved. The reduced the stress and disorder that comes with applying to various schools and for various scholarshipsI live in an apartment barely off campus so I cannot say much about the residence halls and apartments on campus. But from what I\\'ve heard and seen, it\\'s not too bad living on campus. All the dorms I\\'ve visited are very clean and well kept outside of what residents do to them. So they definitely are not bad.As mentioned, I am a part of Greek life. I joined Beta Theta Pi. I met them at orientation, and they made it seem very nerdy. So I almost decided to join Kappa Alpha Order. They were very cool, and seemed to be more the party type. But Beta got me involved right away and KA never contacted me. The easiest way to join a frat is hanging out with them a lot prior to rush week. I hung out with Beta for 2 months before I rushed, but when it came to bid day, they told me they were very excited to bid me. They knew my love for them. Finding the right fraternity is all about finding the right fit. We have the party type fraternities on campus, and then we have fraternities like Beta who like to party, but we also like to do more laid back activities and have fun than anything else. Because partying doesn\\'t build brotherhood, but playing golf, going to lunch with one another, and just hanging out at various places getting to know each other does. We are also very involved on campus, probably more so than any other fraternity. We are one of the more respectable, if not the most respectable groups on campus.I don\\'t know much about UTA\\'s varsity sports, but I know we are passionate about our intramurals. We hold events at least once a week, ranging from oozeball, which is muddy volleyball, to bubble soccer. We have large amounts of people playing and watching, and it is very fun and enjoyable for everyone. The only team I ever play for is my fraternity, but there are teams for each fraternity, sorority, dorms, clubs, and apartments.I chose to get as involved as I can with my school through a fraternity and so far it has been the best choice I have made in college. Many people look at a fraternity as a group of guys that like to get laid and drunk, and that may be the case with a lot of them. My fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, is said to be one of the best in the US. We strive to build men of principle, so when they graduate college, they will be far more successful and better off than if you weren\\'t in a fraternity or in another drunken fraternity. It has gotten me very involved on campus and I know way more people than if I weren\\'t in a fraternity. It opened many doors for me, including a better life, a new family, and lifelong friendships. Getting involved on campus is definitely one of the best things anyone can do while staying on campus.I went in and told them that I needed to take out a loan. The lady asked, \"How much?\" I told her and I received my refund check that next week.I love UT Arlington. The professors are the best; they are so willing to help. The students are always friendly, the employees are always friendly, and there are many campus activities throughout the semester.The restaurant options are endless off-campus. I feel like all Arlington is is restaurants.Parties mostly happen on the weekends, that I know of. I\\'ve been to a few at the off-campus apartments and it was pretty fun.I\\'ve never used the computer labs because I have my own laptop. The computers in the science labs are great, though.I\\'ve only been to one of the off-campus apartments. It was very nice and it was walking distance to campus.The weather is not so bad.The shuttle on campus is great. Half of the campus is on one side of a highway and the other half is on the other side of the highway, so the shuttle allows students a ride across the road. Also on the weekends for $1, the shuttle will take you to the mall in the morning and back that night.The process is easy but how the university deducts the money from our accounts is very weak and takes more time then they say. The safety and security on campus is the best. The school has a escort system and emergency stations all around campus for students to use if they ever feel scared or worried. The university has a alert system that will send students based on how they choose a text, email or call when there is a dangerous situation occurring. I feel very safe on campus. Using computers on campus are great there are multiple places for students to access a computer to do what they need. If you need to print something students pay a very little amount to print their assignment. The wifi is okay and sometime does tend to be very slow but it gets me to what i need to view most of the time. The policies at this school are like most. Here the school is big on the honor code and banning the use of drugs, drinking on or near campus. Because of this students feel safe and make the right choices. The fan support and school spirit is pretty okay at the school with a few students being into the fun scene while other tends to stand and watch from afar. Sports are not a big thing at the school. At least not enough for all to be active and supportive. Like any university there are many types of guys or girls you will meet. Everyone is different in their own way and i think this school has a diverse group of guys and girls. There are rarely any good parties at this school. Most parties are either at a different school.Near the campus students can take a shuttle service to the mall, stores or grocery stores if needed. Also near by is a football stadium for people who are fans of football and there is a concert hall for concert events students can drive to see.Depending on where you live on campus and in which building the response varies. In the building i live the building is nice, clean and spacious. There are two options for students to choose from either having a double which is a room with two people living in or a triple which is 3 separate rooms. In both choices the rooms have a sink, bathroom. Triples have separate showers and toilets, and a living room as well. In my building the atmosphere is very quiet and easy to leave and enter the building. Living in the south the weather is generally consistent with days of just sun or days of being cloudy. Of course when the season changes it makes going to class more difficult. But for the most part the weather when it is nice, warm and sunny makes going out fun and easy. When it is raining and cold most students only leave their rooms or house when they must. At this university there are plenty of choices students can choose from such as american, italian, vietnamese, mexican, etc. At each location prices vary with some places being very affordable to some that are a little over priced. Students who attend the school do receive a discount but it is not that significant. The only problem with off campus dining is the limited locations open for late night cravings. From what i have seen living on off campus housing is great. Every building has a good security system so that occupants are safe. with each building there is a set area for parking. The off campus buildings are generally in walking distance to the campus and i know is a little more cheaper than living on campus in the dorms. With living off campus students are able to have access to their own kitchen which in dorms is something we do not have or there is a community kitchen. The nursing program at my school is very competitive. So to be able to get into the program i must maintain the best of the best grades. During orientation students who decide to pursue nursing are given the information regarding what classes are needed to be taken, exams and application due dates for entry into either the fall or spring nursing program. The workload is tough and very rigorous and takes up a majority of your time, as does any major. There are many facilities for students to study and ask for help if needed. The academics offered at my school is pretty great. There are many classes for students to choose from and decide to enroll in especially depending on their major. There are separate buildings for each specific subject and/or major. Professors are generally lenient and understanding of a students concerns and problems if such were to come up. Also, professors give good and reasonable office hours for students who have questions or need more help. Registration is a confusing process especially if you are new to the school but guidance does a good job to explain and tell students how and where to register during orientation. Once classes start the workload is dependent on your class choice (honors or not) and most of the lessons are pre-told to students so that they know what to expect, nothing is a surprise. Most students study in the library, lounges, dorm rooms, outside if weather permits. Dining options on campus are great. At this university there is a cafe where it is all you can eat from students who live on campus or off campus, though all students must have a meal plan to enter. In the cafe there are multiple stations such as a wrap station, a burger station, comfort food, pasta, pizza, salad bar, dessert bar for students and staff. If the cafe is not something you prefer then there are other places such as Chick Fil A, Panda Express, Pizza Hut, Subway, Starbucks, Einstein and Bros. There is a variety of choices students can choose from when it comes to deciding what and where to eat. All these places also except the university\\'s meal plan of \"dining dollars\" which is an additional amount of money students receive when they purchase a meal plan. Meal plans vary from options for on campus students who can choose from an unlimited plan to a limited 165 meal plan. Off campus students also have available meal plan options as well that are some what similar to the on campus meal plans. The dining dollars do also carry over to the new semester if students do not use up all of their dollars. The use of drugs is barely seen on the campus of my university. I barely ever see anyone using drugs or selling drugs. There, at least from what i have seen, have never been pressured to try or do drugs unless they actively decide to try the drug. The university i attend has a no drug/no smoking policy on campus which means no use of drugs or cigarettes is permitted on campus at all hours. Dark unless their is a sports activity going onLots of armed phone robberies and lack of overall patrol at nightClasses are to the point I have not received a lot of financial aid, less than a fourth of my tuition per semester. I\\'ve applied to a lot of scholarships but haven\\'t received any yet.Nothing too crazy, but it is about 30mins away from Dallas, where there are a lot of things to do.If you are in intro classes, you are going to have a lot of trouble getting your hands on a computer.The work is not too bad if you do, do it. The staff in my major is very picky. They are always trying to somehow put a barrier to your goals and your class choices.There is a big diversity group around campus, and everyone pretty much gets along.Lately there have been a lot of on-campus robberies. It\\'s not bad but my building it\\'s a little depressing considering it is a \"Fine Arts\" building. The staff is very picky, some teachers are great and some are okay.Parking is usually not an issueâ€¦ at least around my building.The building is not too bad.The gym is my favorite hangout.Sometimes it\\'s hot, sometimes it\\'s coldâ€¦ you never know with Texas weather.On my building (Fine Arts) there is just one place to eat.I don\\'t really eat on campus because I know it will make me fat.It\\'s a part of college, and if you\\'re of age then it\\'s up to you to partake in these activities. But underage drinking can lead to very bad things and should be looked at as a very important thing to cut down on college campuses. I\\'ve lived on campus and I can\\'t say that I loved it, but it was okay enough to live in.I feel safe mostly during the day among the other students, but at night is when I feel like I could be in danger around other humans walking around. I just want to get to my car, but I have to be on high alert to make sure I don\\'t get mugged or taken.Everyone leaves campus because there\\'s nothing to do on campusWhen we get ice, the sidewalks are awful and slickSome really good days and some really bad daysEveryone\\'s different and accepting of everyone.There isn\\'t a football team at UTA! That accounts for A LOT of non-support from students and also for the lack of importance of athletics. We NEED to have a football team; it\\'s Texas! Most of the professors I\\'ve had seem to be quite knowledgeable. The registration process is fairly easy and the workload just depends on the professor. So far, the workload doesn\\'t seem too bad.There are professional games to attend like baseball and football, lots of shopping areas, and Six Flags. It\\'s a pretty well-rounded area, but I would only live in Arlington if I found a good enough job to convince me to move there!There are a lot of options off-campus. A lot of chain restaurants and also a lot of unique ethnic restaurants are ound locally. I haven\\'t been to all of them so I\\'m not sure about the costs. I am a nursing major and even though I am not in the program yet, I chose this school because I know it has one of the best nursing programs in the state. The Maverick Activities Center is great. It has a lot of equipment and even offers Zumba! It\\'s pretty awesome. I would say that overall, the campus is pretty lenient on attendance. Since I have been attending this school (Spring 2013), hardly any of my professors have taken attendance. The campus is very strict with parking. I always see security going around and checking cars to make sure they have a permit, however, I\\'m pretty sure the school enforces this so much just so it will make more money by fining people every single day. At night, the campus should be more lit. The lights are not that bright and there is maybe only one escort that I ever see, if I see one, outside of the Central library. There should be more emergency phones available because I think they are just too far apart. This past semester, Fall 2013, there were so many crimes that occurred which now make me feel like I am unsafe on campus, especially if walking alone, which is most of the time. rnI think it is a good idea that once midnight, security goes around the library to check student IDs, however, I think they should also go into the bathrooms to check those people\\'s IDs as well because it is possible that non-students could be hiding in there while security is going around to check. I think campus safety should become more of a priority.The value of the food is a little expensive for college students since we are always on a budget. If a student eats 3 meals a day on campus in the UC, it\\'s more than $5 most of the time and it also sucks that every single item is a la carte. Nothing comes as a meal/combo, which definitely makes eating on campus expensive. There should be specials on food since we are paying so much for tuition, books, and parking. Also, the service of the employees is not that great either and the food is not always fresh or hot. If I could do it all over again, I would choose this school. It has a great nursing program, lots of diversity, many clubs and organizations, and lots of events. I also enjoy the Central library, especially the quiet floors. However, during finals, there is hardly anywhere to sit and study; all of the cubicles are taken. Also, throughout the library, there should be more outlets to plug in electronic devices; there are definitely not enough compared to the size of the library. College Park Center is new and AMAZING, & the MAC.There are attractive people, but not everywhere.People drink and smoke, but that\\'s about it.Easy process, excellent options available.Mostly rundown apartments on Cooper Street. Dell desktop computers are available, and also iMac labs.Decent school if you want to get a degree from an average state university. Opportunities are available if you look for them.It\\'s Texas. Every Texan knows what to expect in this \"bi-polar\" weather, but in the end, it is very enjoyable to see the campus change from summer to fall.More options are needed, other then the \"[first-time-freshman] scholarships\", and if you lose a scholarship, it should be the students right to at least have a chance of getting it back...If an assignment needed to be typed, e-mailed, or printed, UTA\\'s computer labs were the place for me.So far UTA has been great to me, other than the fact that I lost my scholarship because I WAS a UT CAP student. UT Ausitin was and is my dream school, that\\'s the only thing that keeps me from being fully satisfied with my campus. However, I barely finished my first semester, and the aforementioned might just change.The campus\\'s strictness is \"not to strict\", and not even close to \"average\" for the most part. Fun is welcomed as long as everyone follows the rules, which is perfect for me.I have gone to UTA\\'s health center about a couple times or so. The service is great an all, but with a population the size of UTA, either the center must become larger, or a second one must be built before I can give it an \"It\\'s excellent\" review.Not on the top of people\\'s minds, UTA\\'s athletic department is very underrated. However, if enough attention if brought, I\\'m sure one day they will be as popular as any UT Austin game. Not to mention, our track team, cross-country team, and basketball team are already major competitors in their conferences.With many places to hang out at or around UTA, the word \"boring\" will only be caused by doing nothing.Being an International Business major opens up a lot of door, not just at UTA, but outside in the work-force. For example, when I was at orientation for my first job and was asked if I was going to attend college, my answer (involving UTA and my major) brought impressed faces to the people in the room.\"When the going gets tough, the tough gets going.\" If a class is getting the best of you, don\\'t fear, for the professors are always there for your assistance.rnWith the new \"College Park Center\", the brain-warming atmosphere in the \"Central Library\", the memorable \"Maverick Stadium\" (band life), the \"Connection Cafe\" (the king of interactions), and the most popular \"Maverick Activities Center\", UTA is definitely a place to reconsider.I enjoy UTA\\'s diversity-- it has welcomed me to a whole new world. On top of that, the professors are very understandable when it comes to being a college student. Classes may be/get difficult, but office hours are always available. Honestly, I\\'m surprised UTA is not int the same tier as A&M and UT Austin, but I\\'m sure it will get there.UTA has welcomed me to a drug-free environment. Sure, there have been a few frat parties that have been known for their use of alcohol, but in the end, the option to partake is up to the individual.I\\'m a commuter and don\\'t really get to see much of UTA\\'s nightlife, but when I have stayed late for band practices and it\\'s activities, I\\'ve seen only very little socialization.The University of Texas at Arlington is one of the most diversed schools in the nation, and acceptance is a common sight throughtout the campus.The \"Connection Cafe\" at The University of Texas at Arlington always lightens things up after a long day of studying.there is not too much going on..I would rather stay at home with friends.I did not see nor hear about drug use on my campus.My financial aid process was somewhat confusing, but not awful. I have not really started my major but the classes so far are interesting Some professors are very passionate about what they teach There are things to do in Arlington and people often drive to other places around the city It has been ok so far and i have met a lot of peopleWe have a health center that is available to students The college park center is home to new restaurants I don\\'t live on campus so i am not sure how it is likeThere are some parities but you have to go outside of campus to find good ones. The MAC is a new workout center that has a lot of equipment available. There are many things to get involved with you just have to figure out what they are. There is not Transportation in Arlington. It has barely started a trial transportation program and there are some shuttle buses on campus but if you want to go anywhere else you need a car. There is WIFI locations pretty much all over campus but sometimes it is better if you have your own laptop then rely on the Library because it gets crowded There are some choices but they can be pricey.They give the run around a lotIm not really a party personI prefer eating at the plazaI don\\'t really like the parking meters and reasons for ticketing is ridiculousNot many are available to me.The school is very diverse, so there are people of all races and preferences.Classes are very difficult and often departmental, but that is engineering, is it not?Workload is way too much, compared to other colleges I have attended, but I expected it.  Great opportunities for my major after graduation though.Not sure about the internships, trying to get my first one now, but if you are like me, with less than a 3.5....good luck.I am not sure how much the school crime has changed, but the police do a great job keeping the students aware of incidents.They have new engineering and sports facilities, but they are not for class use.Its okay.   At least they offer Starbucks at the main library and university center.I am not a dorm resident, so I can only rate from what I hear and read in the school paper.One cafeteria to eat at for 8 bucks/meal, (unless you get a meal card).  Otherwise it is a Panda Express, Pizza or Chicken sandwiches...or walk a few blocks for something else.Arlington is in between Dallas and Ft. Worth, so there is plenty to do within a thirty minute ride.  Not much to do in Arlington unless you are a football or baseball fan with lots of money.The city just began public bus routes this year and it costs almost as much as driving a car because you have to change busses several times and pay additional fees if you are not on the direct route. The school shuttles are okay though for getting around the school.Most assignments require computer assistance and although the school has computers, many are broken within a month of class onset and the ones available are usually occupied with a student surfing facebook. UTA pushes diversity too much.  Most students in my classes are foreign and I often find it difficult to network with other students because many of these students only associate with other students from their home countries.I don\\'t  know, I am not in a frat.The parking costs are way too high and unless you are a staff member you will have to walk at least a half-mile and up to 3 city blocks to find a parking spot. My classes usually start at 10 am , but I have to get there by 0630 to get a decent parking spot.  Don\\'t dare leave for lunch or you will regret it.  I am an engineering student, so I don\\'t get much time to get involved with sports activities, but other students seem to enjoy them.University of Texas at Arlington is an extremely diverse and accepting campus who offers acceptance to all which is another example of experiencing the real world.Meeting all sorts of people.Being in Texas, the weather can sometimes be predictable. It\\'s mostly hot, but when it\\'s colder than usual, you can expect cancellations which is great because they think about the students and the staff\\'s safety.They offer meal plan options which I like. they have cool locations and options of food on campus. Walking from  my dorm it literally takes two minutes for me to walk to get something to eat.There is a very strict policy of no drugs on campus and enforcement of it.I received financial aid but as far as scholarships, I met the criteria but didn\\'t receive any school sponsored scholarships which was ridiculous but of course they did offer me the option of loans.Personally,  I haven\\'t met that many Greek members. They aren\\'t a huge part of the campus but they are always promoting their fraternity or sorority.There\\'s a diverse amount of them.The university offers a great number of computer labs and resources.They are mostly mac computers and they are very fast. There is wifi all around campus available to students and the faculty.Our best known sport is basketball, they need to have a football team.It would bring way more people in resulting in ore money. The new president has made clear that he doesn\\'t see football in the future. That is the major downfall of going to University of Texas at Arlington.I don\\'t stay off campus but from what I have experienced, the off campus apartments are by a busy intersection, but the school does provide a shuttle for the off campus locations.To tell you the truth, my school doesn\\'t really have an out of control night life, which isn\\'t a bad thing. They are very strict about drugs on campus and alcohol usage in the dorms.There is a lot of off campus dining options they all offer good prices and some offer student discounts.They could be better about letting students know they have discounts though.Around UT Arlington, there is a large mall, a baseball and football stadium including various restaurants and shops around the area.I have good professors so far. The registration process is highly organized.Because of Uta\\'s exclusive and competitive nursing program, it causes a lot of pressure and stress to get in.They only let a small number of people in. If anything I think they should change increase that small number and to be more realistic.The University of Texas at Arlington is a very diverse college, in fact, it is rated the 5th diverse college of the nation. Because of all the different cultures of students, it gives us students a taste of the real world. They are less expensive than other institutions.They provide a comfortable campus life for students like myself who stay on campus. I can honestly say I love my dorm room and its central location on the campus.I am enjoying being a student at UTA so far.The University of Texas at Arlington has an amazing Athletics center, it\\'s referred to as the \"MAC\". It has an indoor track, and plentiful work out equipment. The library is great, it\\'s huge and has plenty of resources like the writing center to name a few to help aid students.Not many drugs are on campus. Just alcohol, but usually the alcohol holders are at least 21.Greeks are greek.They have activities and are picky about their social circle.Scholarships limited to specific majors.Texas weather changes randomly. At times even the weather reporters can\\'t get it right.The more people you know the more parties you\\'ll be introduced to.Just average. Nothing head turning.A lot more housing areas are being built.there are a lot more options in neighboring cities.Not too big, not too small. Very diverse and good size.Advisors are very helpful in finding internshipsNot much public transportation, but the school works well without it.If you do not like the weather in texas .. give it ten minutesfills quickly, so get there earlyI can\\'t afford to eat out.labs are located in a variety of places around campus.Again, I stick to myself.Good programs, but small schoolI stick mostly to myself I\\'m totally happy with living off campus, I actually just bike to school when the weather is acceptable. It takes like 5 minutes to get to campus where I liveI\\'m okay with the weather its not random. In the winter we did get ice, so they closed the campus for couple of days to let the ice melt If you want the night life its not hard to find it I\\'m just not one of those students. It was a simple task. I filled out the application that was needed, need they sent me the possible funding they will provide me and I decided to accept them or notThe ethnicity of the school is very broad. I think it\\'s cool to be able to look around and see so many students with different backgrounds. Then the option of doing something on campus is always there you just need to go ask.   On Campus there are three libraries, main library, Fine Art/ Architecture Library, then The Science & Engineering library. There are always campus events to attend to. All the students on campus all seem to be friendly to the other random student. The campus has a shuttle that goes from various spots on campus to the local off campus apartments and off-campus parking lots  I\\'m happy with the major I chose, I have a interest in the field it covers. Its a little stressful though. I don\\'t have one but I plan on to get one, for its required for my Major There isn\\'t a football team at UTA the great sport that is greatly known for is the wheelchair basketball team.I wouldn\\'t really know I live in a off campus apartment near by. I\\'m only on campus for classes or to get a bite to eat between classesI\\'ve not really done much with the school, but the option to do something is always there. It\\'s nice we have our own health clinic, it\\'s great service and great price too.There are computer labs in each of the three libraries on campus There are big parking lots all over campus. I would saw that its nice, but you might be far from your class depending on what parking lot you choose.I\\'ve never come across any major drinking or drug issues. I haven\\'t noticed any problems concerning diversity. We have a good range of students who seem to be very accepting.I don\\'t live on campus but I haven\\'t heard any major complaints about the housing.I drive my car to school and other than having to park way out, I haven\\'t had any problems.Not too much school spirit, but the facilities are nice and always kept up.I haven\\'t seen much in the field of internships or student research opportunities. I wish they had more out there for biology students or at least helped us become more aware of them. I haven\\'t used them much but from what I can tell, there is a good number of computers and they work well.There seems to be a lot of crime around the campus, but no so much at campus. I like that I get alerts straight to my phone of crime watch warnings.A little confusing at times, but figured it out eventually.Depends on the professor and what their policy is.They will work with you if you have problems.Do lots of research on the dorms and ask around.Be involved in your major and it\\'s awesome.Some programs are more competitive than others.It\\'s only bad when you have to walk everywhere.Depends on who you know and how they act.Computer labs are helpful but they aren\\'t open alotIt will be best to walk with at least one person.It depends on who you know.get a car if you go off campus a lot.Parking is the absolute worst.Their rules are lenient and easy to follow.Get involved on campus. You will definitely have funMen\\'s basketball is the most popular sport.The University of Arlington spend a lot of time on get students involve in sport activities. there is a good school spirit and athletic facilities. Arlington is a small city and there are not much going on.nothing bad happened at UT Arlington because Arlington is a small and safe city. Everything at UTA is within a walking distance so if you live on campus you don\\'t need to have a car. car are needed for students who live off campus. the local weather does not affect the campus because building has great heating and air conditional system. there a different variety of food and coffee. price are decent. professors are friendly and well prepared. they really pay close attention to help students to success by having flexible hours after class in case student have problem on a specific subject. Excellent instructor who speak the language they teach and provide different advice on how to success in the major being study. For instance there is opportunity to study abroad and practice  the language being teach. '"

       "'steer clear if you are a transfer student  i have been waiting for my classes to be transferred in since may of last year and still nothing  everyone is quick to pass the buck  my advisor

would get back with me that day and she didnt  i was unable to attend this semester due to my advisor not following through and the fact she didnt even have any appointments available until after the semester started  so far i am not impresssed and i am looking at other universities  if you are a transfer look elsewhere before considering uta or get ready for a lot of emailing  calling  excuses  and headaches uta is not a large campus  it s a nice size  great opportunities if you go look for them  the professors are good people good is nice has new things and new building therenndfkghiagcgvc

foiwetfywt pouft f foytfy fy tfy tewf ouwfuyew tf frmost of the psychology classrooms and math classrooms need to be updates  i have walked into a classroom so packed  no one could get to a seat without knocking over another student s  laptop  the classrooms need lapel or audio services for professors who have extremely soft speaking skills  the tour only showed the most updated classroom which doesn t reflect the whole campus  this campus needs a major renovation the university of texas at arlington has modern archutecture that gives the campus a fresh feel  it is refreshing to see a newer campus  especially when most big universities have older architecture there is a bit of construction happening currently and parking sucks majorly in certain areas  more parking garages would be ideal and time space saving to be able to get to class  most of the staff is good i have been at the university of texas for the past two years  i love the diversity here  the school has an amazing population of international students  professors are extremely helpful and truly care for their students  there are a number of opportunities for students to get involved in research  news about campus activities are not well spread and i would like for their media involvement to get the news out to improve i wish we did not have to pay for parking permits  there should be free parking for students with a permit  everyone is friendly except the advisors should be more helpful and should give you more resources to help you succeed in school it has been wonderful to be in this online program  the instructors have been helpful and encouraging  i would recommend this school to anyone the university of texas at arlington is a great school with a vast diversity compared to other schools  the professors and academics at this school are great as long as you search up the professors rating on rate my professor to find your ideal professor for a class diverse community with great academics these attracted me because of the nursing programs and the unique geographic location  all the universities have great reputations and the students that graduate from the programs find jobs quickly  the nursing program at the university of texas is ranked   th in the nation  florida state university was the first nationally ranked nursing program in the state of florida  there is a variety of students and club organizations  which allow the school to become diverse so there are more opportunities to have a unique college experience  another reason i chose these schools is because of the similarities to my high school  which would make adapting to the new states and environments more comfortable and familiar  the number of students in the classes are not too high like some other large schools  that makes the academic atmosphere more conducive to learning so that the professors can spend more one on one time with students the nursing faculty are extraordinary and care for all students  i think there should be more campus spirit because many students are not involved  overall i would recommend utathe school gives you many choices to help you study like six free tutoring sessions when you come in as a freshman and relaxation outside of class if you re feeling stressed out like the university center where all students can go to hang with friends or nap like some students  all of my professors i ve had so far have been awesome and are more than happy to help you with you don t understand at uta  you will not only have the opportunity to excel in studies but also have a great learning experience outside the classroom  there is no student problem that will be remained unsolved at uta  they will have assistance in every which way when i went to see go to see uta  i really liked how they were building new apartments so more people can live on the campus  i also really liked how close by it is for me so i don t have to worry about driving out further or going out of state for college  the staff there is really nice and very welcoming i appreciate the diversity in my school  there are also resources available for students to succeed academically and career wise  there are lots of research laboratories and we ll trained professionals  however  i will be happy if my school provide more scholarship opportunities for international students  they lack in that area  international students pay out of state tuition and international student fees  it s a whole lot the school is very diverse and accessible if you want to live on or off campus  you can get very involved in student life without it ever being too  big   most classes aren t too big and the professors are very accessible  i would like to see a football team again  nothing else would really bring all the students together like that it s a good school but it doesn t have a good campus life  there s plenty of things to do in the area around the school though  the professors are good but some are hard to understand  overall  i d stay here for the education this university is very diverse and has been quickly growing since my freshmen year   all of my professors have been very helpful and approachable  and i have encountered many opportunities that i wouldn t have found elsewhere as an information systems junior at university of texas arlington  i love how connected the classmates are  there are always study groups and professors willing to help you along  so you can pass your classes  the campus is clean and beautiful to walk around  i love how there s always things happening and of course  the food diversity is the most exciting part about the school  there are so many things to do that will make someone open their eyes to really view the world  from the food to the students there is so much diversity and it is amazing  i love hanging out with people who have different beliefs than me and who are from different countries  everyone is very accepting of others who are from a totally different world than them drug safety is not even a problem on campus  there are no students who drink nor do drugs and i love that  i don t have to worry about a student breaking the school law or students getting hold to alcohol easily on campus  peer pressure doesn t seem to exist on campus unless it is behind closed doors which it is not my overall experience is amazing because everything that my school has to offer has been so helpful to my future success  i love my fellow classmates and professors  i also love the different clubs that are offered  most of all i like the challenge that the school gives because it builds me up for the real world  i love how not many of my classes have a large number of people in it  i only have one class with over a     students in it  i love uta and i will enjoy my college years with no complaints student careers are very important  to the school  so they make sure students are offered the best tools and internships while they study in their desired field  they have fairs where students can go and apply for jobs and internships to expand their experience in their field  their are many job openings around the school that are great for volunteer hours or just to earn money campus safety is handled very well on campus  there is rarely any trouble that happens  but when it does happen security is quick to take care of the situation  personal safety is definitely not a problem  student can walk across campus with no fears at all  that s because campus police arrive much faster than the city police  i feel      safe on campus which makes my experience at uta ten times better campus housing is great because the school has a program where every major has a special pal  that pal is like a mentor and always there for the students  so housing made a change where every pal gets to live with the students in their groups  plus it is a great environment where everyone gets to know each other and learn more about each other and the school  i love that the housing also comes already     furnished  there is not much that you have to bring except all the important belongings  all of the buildings are well kept together and a nice walk or bike ride from the school  there are also options for those who want to live off campus but close to the school with the different apartment buildings that surround the school  students get great deals on apartments since uta shares a partnership with the apartment complexes the greek life on campus is amazing and they treat non greeks as if they were apart of their group  greeks are viewed as the life of the party whenever they are around  the atmosphere is never awkward there is always something to talk about or laughing that goes on  they are a great asset to the school and the different activities that are offered to new students the school is really big in school spirit  the first day of orientation the cheerleaders along with the basketball players taught the incoming freshman all the sports song  it was a really amazing experience because they were so excited and passionate about their school song and supporting their teams  the coaches have little activity because they let the players build and help each other  they are there whenever the team needs their support and guidance  i love the athletic department at the university of texas at arlington  it is another great aspect to the college university of texas at arlington is the best school by far  i am very proud of my decision  this school is great because the students and professors are the friendliest people i have ever met  both are great when it comes to needing help and making sure students are on the right track to graduating  the environment is more like a family rather than a school and i love the idea of there being no problems at all that changes my opinion about the school  my favorite part about the school is how interacted they are with the students  there are always different fairs going on such as  job fairs  protest against police brutality and many more  i can t imagine myself at any other school  i fit perfectly at the university of texas at arlington i dont live in campus but seeing the great atmosphere here makes me want to move in next year they dont really have a huge impact on campus from what i have seen  when i do see them at student fairs they dont really seem happy to get new recruits uta has one of the best gyms that i have seen  also their outdoor courts are amazing and clean i would choose to come here again because everybody is so friendly and kind  most schools students would say nothing and keep to themselves but uta is different getting a degree in engineering and nursing here is considered a great thing  anything else is practically unimportant  luckily i am in the process of gaining the former some of the courses are fast paced  but that is to be expected if you are taking higher level course than anyone else  i e  chemistry for engineers  calculus  and more  the teachers are almost always happy to help the students here and encourage us to ask questions and take advantage of there office hours  don t expect too much when it comes to english professors teaching a segment in an engineering class there seems to be a lot of petty crimes that happen around campus  there is a clinic and police station on campus though  so student can have fast access to any help they need i really do not know much about the greek life on my campus other than that there is an entire part of campus dedicated to just the housing of the fraternities sororities  some of the band centered fraternities sororities help the marching band during lunch and more my school does not have a football team  which is a big part of college sports  especially in texas  this may be a good thing as it allows more funding for other important things  like an education  basketball is pretty popular here though  but the most popular things are the intramural sports  also  for marching band  since we do not have a football team  not many of the student body has even heard of the band school has been okay the last couple of weeks  the campus is not that big compared to others so getting around is easy  especially if you have a bike  one thing though  there are a lot of indians at this school  and many of them have very thick accents  so it sometimes becomes a frustrating to understand them during class discussions and i do not want to be rude and ask them to repeat what they said multiple times you get what you payi think that uta has decent housing and average social atmosphere  i think that ut arlington has great school policies that has a lot of influence on student social life and academic  i like the university of texas because it has a good computer lab  printing system and there tutor available if you need help in any subject  for instance math  spanish and english  this type of group need to worry about helping student to success at school then having a lot of party housing at uta is just ok  they need to build more apartment close by the university with comfortable cost and space  parking situation near uta is very bad  there is not enough parking space on and off campus  uta lack on parking  they need to do something about this problem  the university that i am attending has a poor dining option that it is close the school  if you would to spend a good time you need to drive a few mile away to find a good restaurant i think my school has a decent  computer lab and printing system  it is reliable and flexible  there is a lot of interest in athletics in my school  the team spirit is palpable and the athletic facilities are great i really dont know much because i dont live on campus the local weather does not really affect my campus experience significantly  the shuttles are great and escorts are available after office hours printing on campus is cumbersome  the computer lab serving my department has few computers but overall  the tech support is great and the wireless network is very reliable it s great for sure  i just do not use it all the time i think off campus dining is just right for on campus students the food is actually okay  you just get tired of it after a while i think the availability of computers is just fine the environment is just right for college students i have not seen any suspiscious activities so far the classes are challenging  the professors help you out when you need them i am a ba in chemistry major and it helps me to also minor in frenchi am currently enrolled in an online program and the academic load is sized appropriately with ample assistance when needed the professors are accessible  registration is simple and if need they will hold your hand all the way through the food on campus is really great they have healty fast food places such as subway to  buffet of a variety of foods diversity at our school is the primary goal  we welcome anyone from anywhere and they can feel t home because their is special places for them to worship special things and many events for different academics is a great value at our school  having many tutors available when needed and lots of study groups that are doing the same major as you and are mostly juniors and seniors that have already experienced what im going through and also did really good there is a variety of academic s at uta since it is the  th most diverse university we have a lot to choose fromuta is like a little town everything is walking distance and made for college students to enjoy and feel safe while doing itcampus housing ranges from         a month that s in dorms and the higher the nicer  don t get me wrong they are all meant to feel like home the wifi is really relevant around the school and everywhere you go there is always computers  but not very up to date but the networking on them works uta always has many events going on from casino night to ozze ball   mud volleyball  to the homecoming paradeat my school uta we have many was to get around that don t cost a dime  like the shuttle bus goes all around campus from the football stadium to the apartments around campus  also there is golf carts that you can call anywhere to come pick you up and take you where you need to go on campustons of restaurants in and around campus  most around campus restaurants are open late you re going to run into your average run of the mill people here  very little interaction activities if you are a transfer make sure you have your parking pass and follow all parking regulations for the first few weeks of school because the campus police are everywhere other than the occasional rain the weather here is excellent  it usually is a little hot but it is texas after all great town with plenty of entertainment  six flags is right down the road and if you want to catch a professional baseball or football game that is also right down the street plenty of computers  but when it is crunch time at the end of the semester it s important to have your own to make sure you have access to the internet transportation is not really needed to get around the school  most things are within walking distancethere are tons of options around the school for nightlife  most places are a little bit of a drive but no more than       minutesthey re very strict about frats and sororities getting drunk every weekend so many brown people here well theres been    thefts in the past two months so yeah bad bc i get allergies all the freakin time my chemistry professor is the best teacher in the whole world other than that all professors suck not so sure about it i didn t do the alcohol survey and got no penalty for it either they need to invest a lot more in baked potatoes and sour cream everyone does their own thing  you could go all   years of college without making a single friend  not saying people here are unfriendly or stuck up  but just no one goes out of their way to make friends  don t even think about seeing attractive guys here either  i saw a meme that accurately described this  it said something along the lines of  don t know if he s cute or it s just because i go to uta  at least the campus shuttle is free  the one thing all commuters complain about however is the parking available at uta or lack thereof it was neither an easy or difficult process  you just have to be aware of paperwork and other things that the bursar office requires of you and it shouldn t be too bad  also  be mindful of your gpa because scholarship renewal depends on it being at a certain minimum there are always crime reports being sent out and it does not make me feel safe on campus at all  however students do have the option of calling an escort so you don t have to walk alone around campus at night need to stay open laterit s ok but could have a few more on slow weekendthere isn t much nightlife at school  this school is mostly a commuter school so all the people that are at parties are at either clubs or at off campus apartments  also i don t know of many nightclubs in arlington  i believe most of the nightclubs that students go to are either in fort worth or dallas  which they aren t that far away  but hard to get to for people who don t have cars  also there is hardly anyone here on the weekends i would say the guy girl ratio and whatnot is pretty even  the guys are pretty handsome  and everyone pretty much dresses casually  some people wear sweats  but the overwhelming majority are the t shirt and jeans type  i really like the athletics at the school  they have intramurals that are pretty well attended  also our main sports are well attended  our main sport is basketball and homecoming week is pretty big  the athletic facilities are great and they have a lot of it i would say that the campus is pretty strict about illegal things  they don t want to see drugs or alcohol in the hands of underage kids  they also are really big on the honor code  and you can see it some of everywhere and also on crime  they put out things on people who commit crimes and try to stop them  but they re pretty lenient on things like attendance and visitation in dorms i would say this campus is pretty diverse  i know that they always talk about how diverse they are and they won a couple awards for it  i think you can also see the diversity when you look at the different groups that are on campus  there are various religious and ethnic and other type of organizations at the school  and it seems that pretty much everyone is accepted all the time the student life on campus is great during the week  the athletic centers are great  the basketball stadium is really big and a lot of fun  also the activities center is full of stuff  there is a lot of machines there  two tracks  and a lot of space to rent  arlington has a lot of attractions  they have three big shopping centers  a mall  the highlands  and the outlet mall  also there is the baseball stadium  the cowboy s stadium  hurricane harbor  and six flags  and also there is a number of parks around arlington  and on fridays the mall gives discounts to uta students i really like the campus dining  on campus we have a dining hall and then a variety of fast food options as well as a convenience store  the dining hall has a variety of food every day  although because it is more expensive  i don t go as often  the  plaza  as we call it has quite a few options as well  and i usually end up going there for most of my food if i don t have any at my dorm like any campus  there is crime  but there are ways to combat this  they have police escorts throughout the day and students can call them when they need it  there are also police stands that shine blue and when you push a button it calls a police  seeing those and having the escorts make me feel safe on campus i live on campus so i don t know much about off campus housing  but i do know that there are quite a bit of options for people who want to live off campus  they have off campus apartments and houses  and there are neighborhoods close enough to the school to get an apartment there as well  most of the off campus apartments are so close to the school that you can walk to get to campus  and they have some of the same amenities that the dorms have  but the other ones are like regular apartments i know that some of the places off campus do give students discounts  and at some places you can use these things called dining dollars that are equivalent to money and come with meal plans  there are quite a few fast food options as well as sit down and buffet type options on cooper where uta is located  and the cost is usually pretty good  most of the food places cost less than    and most others are less than    per person we have quite a bit of high power computers on campus such as mac computers and printing is relatively easy  the main place to print is in the library but they have a lot of printers and it is hardly crowded  however  it would be easier to get a personal computer  there are quite a bit of online homework websites that you need to get used to  but if you don t have one  the library will either rent you out one or they library is almost always open so you can go in there  also the network reliability is good and the speed and wireless access are pretty uniform throughout the campus the weather hasn t had much affect on my campus experience  it s been pretty even the whole time they have a pretty good selection  but i there are some majors they don t have such as chemical engineering which i really want to be in they have quite a bit of undergraduate research which really interests me  and i know that the work load is a little hard  but my major is everywhere just started but so far so good could be worse but could be a lot betteri will purchase my own next semester for this i am married and don t pay attention to any of thisexpensive for those without a prepaid dining plan there is a long walk from parking to cob building  any precipitation is a bad thing as a part time student   i never see any drug use the grounds are well kept parking is ridiculous  lots of underage drinking  they only care about stupid stuff and dont really pay attention to the real issues some buildings are new  some are really run down and old  newest thing is engineering wing and the school doesnt really care about anything but engineering greek life here is a joke  nobody takes them seriously at all  they re only good for the parties that get busted in like every single time not good  not terrible  not as many options as would seem  do not get the most expensive meal plan  because you will get tired of the dining hall after like two weeks cost is ridiculous for how little spots there are  they ridiculously ticket you my experience was okay  not good exactly  definitely wanna go somewhere else now the police are around  and will write you tickets with no question  many many many robberies walking around campus we are ranked one of the most diverse campuses in america for a reason  there s seriously so much it s ridiculous it s texas  the weather is always gonna suck  but the school can t control that there is a lot of financial aid available  you just have to actually make an effort to get it the roommate process is terrible  many of the dorms are old  the whole process was just terrible  always get a private  they have plenty of resources available so help really is always there  but it still is very difficult for math and science  the science  math  and engineering classes are the most challenging  because this is an engineering schoolyeah there are computers around  but it s just so much easier to have your owngood dry campus mostly  no visible drugs everit s not bad  not too much crime herewould prefer to go to utlots of diverse people  huge melting potdallas cowboys and mavericks help the sports scenelots of cute girls but not very open i am still new but willing to learngreek life is okay  needs morenot much nightlife  go to dallasi am the kind of person that takes their own device there because the labs are always extremely crowded  but i cannot complain on the wi fi it lets me do what i need to do  lets just say that if you have class at   you better be there at      the school seems like a city of it s own  it has its own veins and beats a complete life of its own and just like any person place  my campus has its faults that make it extremely difficult for me to get over at times but at the end of the day it is what it is and it s trying its best to stay alive  i think that many people aren t as involved in sports as one imagines  walking around campus at night is creepy dont park anywhere without a permit   cool greek row far from campushas a decent amount of optionsshuttles ever so often and escortslots of diversity and international studentsrnthe surrounding area is ghetto the library is the place to be for all your study needs  provides hangouts  quite study areas  computer labs  cafe  printers and much more ut arlington parking is quite a mess i ve tried going their       minutes before class starts to no luck and even several hours before hand  the spots get taken up really early and are only empty in the afternoonevery person i ve meet at ut arlington is different whether it be race  religion  nationality but in the end everyone gets along quite nicely  every type of restaurant scene you can ask for  however the arlington is flooded with fast food places so many of these gems are hidden there are lots of sports here except football  so the main sports people attend are basketball and volleyball  the basketball team nearly made it into the ncaa tournament   straight years  so i hope next time they can make it the whole point of sports is to teach teamwork  instill life long lessons  and to some degree win games  but if your team isn t winning it is an immediate reflection of your campus  that is the problem at uta  when the basketball team loses a game the entire campus feels like they have lost  which over the years has caused students not to participate in a lot of those activities never have i had a fear of being on campus  but to be honest when your race is the majority  there really isn t anything to feel uncomfortable for  but i ve seen many individuals uncomfortable  i believe it can be a frightful experience to be dropped off in an unfamiliar environment and asked to adapt  the campus is remarkably safe though it obviously isn t the universities fault  but arlington is simply a city that has developed itself  over the years its slowly digressed into a city that is visualized as poor  it is also going through a large economical change  which will offer better options with living  but at a much higher price there is always something to eat around campus  wingstop and chicken express i know for sure have a student discount  there is also a chiptole not far from the schoolit is a smoke free campus  however if you do get caught on campus or on campus dorms  apartments there are serious consequencescomputers are great on campus  they even have mac s in the library  however during crunch times it does get quite crowded  printing is   cents  the speed is great  like your the only one on the internet  personal computer is cool to bring with you regardless but if you must get on one of the computers on campus just know the right times to go to the libraryi will be taking online classes  so my safety and security on the campus is not an issue i believe there is a great selection of off campus dining to be enjoyed by all i have been accepted to the program and anxiously awaiting to start my first class   i am currently trying to get my finances together to pay for my classes   i am in debt with student loans for my daughter s education at oklahoma state university  that is why i am looking for a scholarship for my education   therefore i am unable to tell what i like about my school s program they re very strict which is a great thing because it keeps the students save   also it keeps the rules of conduct clear and concise so that not everyone is going to do the wrong things all the time i have not applied for financial aid  i have been accepted to uta for my bsn  currently working full time and putting my daughter through college at osu i don t notice the drug scene at school because i concentrate on doing my school work and getting the most that i can out of my classes   there s no obvious drug use that i have noticed transportation is very convenient   it mets the needs of most people  i would say  transportation is available to accommodate different hours that students will be uses it the university center at uta is not that big but there is a variety of foods that people can choose from  also  the mac  activity center  is rather nice with plenty of work out machines and an indoor track the drug safety at uta is getting better in my opinion ever since they made it a tobacco free campus sports are very important  try to get people more active and involvedstudents seem to have a good time  many friendshipsa lot of down time  rooms are crowdedi think it s great that uta ha  it s own bus that has no stops  only from and to the universitythere s all kind  of people herei believe that the uta has good academics program criteria not outlined until admittedreasonable rent rates and good selectionlong  hot summers and short  mild winters the campus is vibrant and full of things to do  the campus could use a few pedestrian bridges or tunnels since students are constantly crossing the streets parking requires either parking passes or spending a lot on parking meters for a short periodthe financial aid process was not too difficult  if you have to cal them though you may have to sit on hold for a while i can usually never find a spot in the lot that is closest to my class so if you are okay with arriving early and walking a bit then it is not that bad the bookstore is awesome but their policy sucks all is fair in school and finances  but for the program i am applying to  i need money to pay for the classes itself  so that means more loans and more debt  times are tough  that has to be an easier way to pay for school good amount of grants if you look for them drugs are around  just like any university  mostly smoking or alcohol use  but most students are not involved in drug use not much social interaction at uta  there is a lot of clubs and bars to go to in the surrounding dfw area  but not much around the campus itself it all depends on the field you study  some range from extremely difficult and time consuming  architecture  to pretty lax and easy going  business  with all the in between  its usually a hit or miss with the teachers  there s always a few bad apples in the bunch this is the great state of texas where we can have all   season packed into one day  the winters are bitter with good chances of ice  but no snow  the summers are extremely hot and humid with very little rain  the spring and fall however are some of the most beautiful in all the country with mild temperatures you will find just about everything here  a lot of people think because of our science based programs there are just a bunch of nerds but this is not so  there are many attractive people and most people on campus are easy to talk to and are willing to make room for more friends the computer labs can definitely get crowded so i would suggest you bring a laptop  printing is a fairly reasonable price as long as you find a computer on which to release a printing job  i honestly feel like the school should invest in more computer labs it really all depends on your major here at uta  some majors are easier than others in amounts of workload and studying  such as majors in the college of science  nursing  engineering  and architecture  there are always places to study on campus the only thing i would say is if you want to study with a group you have to search for students on your own  i have not been introduced to any si sessions being here on campus but i have met up with people from my classes to study and that has been somewhat effective  the professors here are great  all of mine show passion for what they re teaching which makes the courses more enjoyable i am actually in a dual program at uta that allows students to work on a pre medical degree in biology and get a masters in healthcare administration  honestly i do not know very many people pursuing this career and i associate more with students who are biology pre med just because i can relate to them  but my advisor is very helpful and we meet before choosing classes each semester which is very beneficial  the work load is tough because it is a dense amount of biology along with business classes and i work part time as well  all of my professors are great but the material is definitely challenging and i think they should incorporate si sessions and more tutoring opportunities parking is terrible  i always have to park two streets away from campus which then takes about    minutes to walk to class there were variety of restaurants off campus but it can get very crowded  usually at night i have been very pleased with the rn   bsn nursing program  the instructors are very educated  informative and accessible  the program is fast paced  but allows time for self reflection  i would strongly recommend this program to other nurses looking to pursue a higher degree for me this is not applicable  as i am pursuing an online degree through ut arlington i am a computer science major  and most of my professors are foreign  such as indian  or chinese  it is kind of hard for me to follow them in class  to deal with that  i have to reread the material at home  waste a lot of my time  however  the professors are all helpful  i am taking    credits and the workload for me right now is ok  not too much there are a lot of different majors offered in my school  currently  i am taking history and english as general education courses  and i like my professors  their lectures are clear and interesting i think it s pretty safe in my campus  there are people everywhere  and arlington is a safe town i live on campus and the dorm i live in  kc hall  requires a meal plan  there are multiple meal plans for resident students  but also for commuters  i love the cafeteria  the menu is different everyday and you can view it online  including the calorie breakdown  they serve a diverse menu  from comfort food  pizza  salad bar  wraps  international  hispanic  indian      soups  desserts  cookies  ice cream  cheese cake     ooouuuuh and every month  they have a bug birthday cake for the babies of that month    i love the cafã©  but you also have subway  panda  pizza hut and other cool restaurants in case you don t like the cafã© or don t have the meal plan uta is very diverse  you see people from different ethnic  religious  cultural background and there are different clubs on campus which you can join to feel welcomed the uta police patrols very often and is very strict  especially when it comes to parking  safety and excess speed loading up the computers are slow but i guess its from everyone using the computers  the internet speed is below average  may have to wait about   seconds for a page to load  printing on campus is pretty good with a good price to pay for printing    cents for black and white and   cents for color its texas so the weather is random some days  it may be hot one day but then cold the next  it sometimes snows randomly out of nowhere  for the most part its hot during the summer and cold during the fall and winter time its a great atmosphere  there is always some kind of event going on every week  near by are several restaurants with different kinds of cultural food  if you don t attend to whats going on then you are missing out on a lot of fun the campus has i dining facility that has a wide variety of choices  as well as a fair selection of fast food establishments in a central area   there are also a number of restaurants within walking distance of campus there are a number of computer lab on campus with high speed internet as well as wifi hots posts through out the campus   there is also a help desk for individuals that are having computer issues the parking is horrid because most of the campus is fighting for parking spaces  many student just begin to park in the apartments parking spaces  there are many places to stay but most of the locations are old and some unsafe so you have to be really careful when choosing there are lots of diners around the campus to choose from including some very low cost places the workload as a nursing student is tremendous  the program expects us to not work but to be able to afford all of the books  scrubs  equipment  and other things on basically no money  the teachers here all believe that they are the only course and the most important so they throw unreasonable amounts of course work and unnecessary clinical paperwork at you  i am very disappointed with this program i came to uta because of their nursing program but i noticed that the advisors here do not support you and the teachers are all very distant and aloof when it comes to student needs uta is a commuter school which means parking in nonexistent and you have to walk a good stretch to get to class most days  in rain  sleet  or snow  this is also texas so it is hot year round the drug scene at ut arlington isn t preeminent  but i have come across situations where people i know engage in those activities  it s said quite often  but it really does matter what kind of people you surround yourself with  so while i don t much of the drug scene  i do know it happens  though not severely  for all freshman  ut arlington does require you to complete an online mini course about drugs and drinking  it exposes you to  what this stuff is all about  and it gives you suggestions to how to deal with those situations if you ever find yourself in them the computer labs at ut arlington are pretty abundant  however  during finals or midterms  it does become quite crowded so it becomes difficult to find a spot  when you log on to a campus computer  it lags and is quite slow at first  but once it warms up it s considerably reliable  most of the computers have all the softwares you need  like word or powerpoint  they have a great printing system  and its very inexpensive   although the only downside  from what i ve experienced  is that you have to print from a uta computer  and aren t able to from your laptop   the wifi speed is quite good  but logging in is quite inefficient  having your own computer may be more convenient  but it wouldn t be detrimental if you didn t have one ut arlington only has off campus housing  either apartments set up near the school for students  no dorms  or you can rent a place nearby  if you are wanting to live near campus  prices are very reasonable  but the neighborhood is rather ghetto it s texas  it tends to be either really hot or cold  the only way i can see that this plays into my campus experience is that parking is terrible and the closest available parking spots are       mile from each of my classes so being subjected to poor weather conditions tends to be not a fun experience varies from nice and updated for some buildings to gross in others  there are a lot of good outdoor and indoor study areas  as well as a pretty good food mall i went to a   yr community college before transferring to uta  the basic policies and procedures are similar  and i have never had any problems for the most part  the only complaint i can offer is that some of the junior senior programs are very stringent     or below is failing and if you miss more than   class  your final grade is lowered by an entire letter grade  i e  a     turns into a       at least in my program  due to the way the classes are set up  there is zero flexibility with taking a semester off due to illness or anything else  you cannot skip a semester and come back  you must wait   year  the quality of professors vary  in most courses  the teachers are very professional and kind  however  in some of the  basics  classes the university employs student teachers  many of which are inexperienced  i even had one that spoke such poor english that i could not understand him   and this was algebra   the building qualities vary depending on the class and location  some are very nice and updated  while others will flood if it rains  have graffiti all in the bathrooms  and have tripping hazards with carpet peeling up and not being repaired  the school does not have a large enough server to accommodate high volume traffic  such as registration time or  when classes start  and will often crash or fail to load pages  the same lack of spending causes a lot of issues in dealing with services such as financial aid  as the phones will always be busy and it is standard for the tuition bill  fa to get the finances messed up  then be a hassle in order to get it fixed  considering though  that this is the lowest priced   yr university near me     k base yearly tuition   i feel it worth the extra hassle  the grounds are very nice and generally kept clean and in good order financial aid can be frustrating but talking to the right people and the department supervising helps i try to avoid fast food  but the authentic ethnic restaurants are good and i am always looking for others texas weather is inconsistent so it is hard sometime to enjoy the weather on campus i m happy with the program but i won t do it again  my goal is to become a dentist but i do have concerns about the competitiveness when it comes to acceptant rate uta doesn t really have a drug scene  if there is any usage of drugs  it s definitely kept on the down low so peer pressure is not a problem  policy regarding drugs is pretty strict anyhow it s texas so it s really hot  the weather is all over the place no matter what season so it s kind of a drag sometimes to be outdoors  when the weather is nice though  there are lots of outdoor activities to do i love the local atmosphere at utarlington  the campus is beautiful and safe and there are so many fun things to do  the maverick activities center is a great place for sports and hangouts  there are also many on campus dining facilities that have many options for all kinds of food as far as on campus activities go  i haven t encountered any issues  the different housing areas though do seem to have some problems but i don t really get into those types of scenes anyway since i live on the completely opposite side of the cafeteria its a long walk  the food is great  there are always different kinds i live in the apartments near uta  but from what i ve heard about the dorms it is very convenient since its really close to the cafeteria the atmosphere at uta is really friendly  there s always someone trying to help you  there are always activities to get the new freshmen together  specially at the beginning of the school year no football in a texas school  everything else is alright downtown arlington is limited  bars and greasy food person i spoke to did not take the time to review my special circumstance document and turned me away immediately there are some apartments close to the campus   they are either new and high priced or semi affordable but not kept up   i think safety is a big concern and only look for places that have some security i am very happy with my major and would choose it again   my plans are to get my bacholars in exercise science and then get my masters in athletic training   i have high hopes in getting a great job when i get out you need to have a good gpa and the program is limited in number to how many they accept   i think the application process is pretty normalyou have to arrive on campus very early in the morning to get a parking spot the guys at uta are pretty normal  girls don t fall head over heels for them i can only speak from what i ve seen  i attend a school that does not have a football team  so that s a big minus point  however  the volleyball team is great  and the mac  which is the athletics building is very nice  the building is open to all students and the staff is very friendly being a first time college student was really a push into the real world  everything that they tell you in high school about college is true  luckily i have some amazing professors that are available to help  and they are enthusiastic about their job applying for scholarships is easy and simple with no complications and right to the point  recommend it for anyone looking to start of who is not sure what they are looking for this school is great  i really love the theatre department and the groups i am a part of many students can expect to get a job after graduation i feel pretty safe on campus  i am comfortable walking alone unless it is night  but that is personal preference i live in arlington hall and i love it  i have a suite and it is great because i get my own room i personally do not like greek life  but others seem to enjoy the greek life here the students and faculty at the school really care about the athletics available i really like my school  originally i was going to transfer out  but now i am seriously considering staying the teachers really care  and there are a lotta options so anyone can persue what they want  there are very few limitations when it comes to academics diversity is a big thing here  but everyone is accepted no matter your religion or race or physical mental appearance i mean some parties there will be alcohol but its college  so it s just naturally expected  there aren t people always walking around drunk  and you hardly see it outside of a few restraunts and the parties i am a little biased since this is the first college i have attended   but i think that it is all great and that the campus as a whole is reaslly open and welcoming to everyone there is a lotta security on campus  espesially in the dorms  and i don t have any concerns about it  the administrators and staff make sure that every student is safe and taken care of hosing on campus ios very good and there are a lotta choices for students  it is kinda hard to be able to live on campus if you wait to long to apply for a dorm but once you get it it is a good experience and a great opportunity that i think everyone should have at least once i don t know much about greek life but i know that a lotta people are in sororities and fratenities and that they are a big part of the uta community students on campus are always getting involved and they show a lot of school spirit  sports are a big thing for this school  and they help everyone get to know one another and they also give a lotta students confidence in themselfs it is diverse and the teachers all care about their students being successful  there are a lotta activities and clubs on campus and it is really easy to find a group to hang with  i am reccommending this school to my high school friends because it is such a great experience  and one i ll never forget i live off campus and commute to school every day  but i have been inside the dorms and they are beautiful  for the nicest dorms  it costs almost       a year and you are required to have a meal plan with the nicer dorms  which is almost       a semester  in my opinion  that is too much for dorms  but in comparison to other schools in texas  it is very reasonable  the dorms have a lot of space  comfy beds  and lots of storage  my friends who live in dorms love it  there are also plenty of study lounges in every dorm building most of of the people at the university of texas at arlington are either white or indian  this is compensated by everyone being so nice the uta atmosphere is cozy but busy   cowboy stadium is down the street  the school itself is trying to get a solid sports program going  and there s an excellent stadium on campus   i ve seen the school spirit and it s great  though the school song could use a lot of work   when on campus you almost feel like you can relax but it just never happens there are several places to dine on campus  with many choices to fit any need of style of student  whether it be to conserve money  eat a vegan lifestyle  or to load up carbs while cramming for finals  pizza    yummy  i often have to resend my papers via fax  this particular semester  fall       it would seem they misplaced a form i had faxed two times  with out proof however i can t positively state the department was fully at fault  there is the possibility i somehow messed up the transaction myself  i ended up hand delivering the form several weeks after the posted due date  despite the belated entry i received the aid intended for me this coming semester one prominent component of the students that attend this college is the tremendous diversity in interests  taking a typical stroll through the complex usually results in the encounter of live music from every genre  everyday there are organizations recruiting students that share the same goals  major  interests  etc   one other quality i have noticed is the variety of age groups  not all students attending are right out of high school  such a mix gives a healthy dose of crazy fun with a mature attitude the food is good and there is always a good crowd everything is in walking distance  unless you re just lazy certain classes fill up too soon and that postpones taking the classes that you need until the next semester or even during the summer there are some people that like to run off with things   the cops make a report on it and it does not seem like anything gets done to stop the problem or catch them most of the classes and instructors have been great   the facilities are well maintained the student life is exciting since you meet new people while going out  also there are many events and clubs people can join that is related to their majors the transportation is good since they have buses that can get you from point a to point b  also you can park at certain areas and let the bus take you to your destination the school is very diverse and has people from a lot of different backgrounds the greek life is all about exciting events and parties  also about meeting new people and feeling the student life style at my school there is a variety of food to eat that is nearby like indian  chinese  mexican  and gyros  the food is not as expensive and its very affordable the school is very safe and the health center is close to your convenience my school has one of the top nursing programs in texas  all the buildings are not as far apart from each other  we have lots of different programs to study for  plus there are monthly programs  also it is a very diverse and fun school  lastly  my school has exciting events and sports never played in other schools like wheelchair basketball we do have buses but they are fairly slow to get places well they have campus police patrolling  fairly lit camps grounds  there are still occasional issues but usually nothing beyond a robbery   they always have an alert system going out if there is an kind of issue no matter how small aside from the club  bar scene arlington has a lot to offer with the rangers ballpark and cowboy stadium just down the street   six flags down the road and a couple of malls and recreational places  but bars clubs are about   min away to the east there is night out in the city and to the west a little bit of country   considering our sports are nothing like ut or a m we aren t too bad   there s a lot going on from wheelchair basketball to mud volleyball  lots of unique things in store and plenty of people involved some older buildings but they ve done tons of renovations and new construction great restauraunts nearby only takes a few minutes to get tono football team  basketball is the only thing we really hear about laptops at the library to check out for free  computer labs everywhere  printing almost everywhere  all up to date windows   and kept in working condition college is kinda in the getto  there are saftey measures put in place though  students are friendly  very diverse atmosphere there are not too many parties at this college  many of the clubs and bars are not close either  you have to drive a good distance to do pretty much anything there are a lot of parking lots  but they fill up quickly  also  many of the lots are pretty far from campus the dorms are pretty great  there are three newer resident halls and even the older ones are kept up well  plus  they are all close to the main part of the campus and the gym the dining hall has a good variety of food available  outside of the dining hall there are plenty of fast food places and restaurants to choose from as well as a mall it can get sweltering in the texas summer heat  the buildings are not too far away from each other tough so it makes up for it  once summer passes it is great i think arlington is a nice city  i just don t have much time or money to explore it i have not noticed any drug behavior at my school  although  this could be because i m too busy studying to notice i am just beginning the pursuit of my master s degree at uta and have been pleasantly surprised at the application process and how helpful the majority of the college has been at helping me acquire the information i need i love how there are so many different majors offered in this school  it allows for people from all walks of life to mingle together and learn from each other arlington is considered the fun capital of north texas  but beyond the big attractions  there ends up being not much to do except for pool halls the film school at uta is small and lovable  a few knowledgeable professors and a group of talented students make up the department but apparently it is the fastest growing one in the art school there are an abundance of parking spaces  including ones that were just built  but the major deciding factor in whether you ll have a spot is how early you decide to show up  the early bird gets the parking space i havent seen any  the campus is even tobacco free there is plenty of parking  it would be more effective use of space if they would build a large parking garage  that was open to general student parking  the majority of the campus is parking lots some old buildings  the life science department needs an upgrade for sure  the labs are very outdated i am a part of uta s engineering program  which i thoroughly enjoy because there is a wide variety of programs and majors  lots of options to choose from  and there are a lot of people in regards to faculty and staff that want you to succeed and will help you do that  to the best of their ability ut arlington has a very diverse student body  there are many different organizations  clubs  fraternities  etc  for whatever you re interested in participating in i don t use the school transportation that much because i have my own car  but i know that there are buses that can take you around campus and to your parking lot if needed  if you get out of class late  you can always call a security escort to drop you off where you need to go around campus there is the connection cafã© which has a variety of food  usually they try to change it up but still it can get boring to eat the same food there  there is also panda express  pizza hut  chik fil a  subway  starbucks  a noodle house and a sushi place whose name escapes me where you can use your dining dollars the cowboys and rangers are fairly close to school which is pretty coolonly   time that there has been an issue at school but  the problem wasnt even at schoolits usually pretty hot because its texas but besides that the hot  its not that badthe places around campus are good  i guess you get kind of tired of eating at dining halls  but when you need something to eat between classes  you can t complainthe night life is amazing even if your under    you can still have lots of fun here at ut arlingtonmy major being business  was so much fun at first i thought i was going to be boring but it turned out ausomethis school is amazing in curriculum registration and the workload isnt even that much  housing is the best â€“ extremely helpful and very well informed and diverse  depending on your particular needsit was pretty easy for me to get into the aerospace program  the most important criteria of course is your gpa but it is not that hard to keep it up but one slip up and it can fall fast the aerospace program is great but there are a few teachers that are not that great and the math portion of the program is terrible  but overall it is a great program to be in the weather in arlington is okay  other then the heat and rain every so often it is pretty nicethe campus has several places where students can eat even if they are on a meal plan  there are some great places that are off campus as well and are not to far from the campus  i knew people who were on meal plans and they enjoyed their food they had a buffet every day and several choices from healthy snacks and fruit as well  and if there is not enough time to eat there are vending machines and there is a store that you can go to and buy  you can also use your college i d to pay for things as well  as long as there is money on the card   the campus is very good about food and saving money i chose uta because of their athletic training program  they are noticed for both kinesiology and engineering  the kinesiology program has a wide variety and the professors are helpful and are able to guide you i m which classes would be best to take for an upcoming semester  they are hands on learning as well and are very informational in lectures  depending on which department a student chooses in kinesiology there are sometimes limited spaces in certain classes because they fill up very fast  whenever there is homework assigned study options include time with a ta or other places around campus  for kinesiology majors a popular study place is the macericks activity center  mac  or the library the uta campus is very safe  security is there if there is a situation  although we have had   incidents in the spring semester of       they were immediately taken care of  i don t feel uncomfortable when i walk around the campus  even at night  if there is anything that goes wrong the school is right on the case as soon as possible and inform others as well  it is very informative and helpful and it definitely helps everyone feel safe the drug use at uta is not a big issue  i have not seen anyone dealing any drugs or drinking  there might be a few people around the campus that might do drugs  but i have never heard about someone doing drugs or seen anyone doing drugs on campus  no one is ever peer pressured either all of my classes are online  so long as i have an internet connection i can perform my work i am attending the university of texas at arlington and i am very happy with the way classes are taught  the professors are cery committed to their subjects and are very knowledgeable  i chose kinesiology as my major and it requires a lot of sciences  recently while i was in the introduction class last semester it was very interesting and reading ahead was an important thing to understand the lecture  the labs were very helpful and we always had opportunities to get practice at different schools around the area  there was homework but not to much to where it became stressful  also after completing the major courses practice hours can be anywhere as long as the professor is ok with the location of your choice  some places include high school s  middle schools  and even athletic training programs i m in the uta academic partnership bsn program  the program is entirely online  you must be extremely disciplined as the workload is much greater than attending classes in person  the online modules with recorded lectures and study material are very helpful parking permits are very expensive for the parking lots you have access to  i was a commuter and must make sure i gave myself plenty of time to find a parking spot and most likely walk a long distance  lots fill up quickly and they are all very far from the most accessed buildings all of the town around campus is full of every restaurant imaginable with every kind of option  it is a very diverse city therefore has options for everyone i am an accounting major  it is one of the hardest majors to earn  continual studying and homework nightly to stay on top of what you re learning  but  an excellent set of professors and business school to help you succeed continual campus security and police officers  surveillance videos  and help towers all around campus  no firearms and no alcohol and tobacco to help keep campus safer the campus has general rules and regulations  keeping firearms off campus  no alcohol or tobacco  and an honor policy for cheating  etc there are many different departments and offices to help you with financial aid  fafsa  scholarships  loans  and grants  there are monthly postings of available scholarships in the office and you can always discuss financial aid with an adviser or worker at the office  however  finding and applying for scholarships is your responsibility  but you have more than enough resources for help based on your meal plan  you can use dining dollars to eat at one of the many restaurants and fast food places on campus or in the area  just about everywhere you go  there is a place to eat that is not part of the cafeteria we have about        students      organizations including fraternities and sororities  seven different residence halls with free laundry tv wi fi  people are highly social  we have multiple various opportunities for help with housing  on campus jobs  employment with your degree as you work for it  internships  you can study abroad  there are peer mentoring groups  student congress  and despite the active lifestyle  everyone is peaceful and focused on academics ut arlington s basketball team is much better than any in the dfw metroplex  and school spirit and morale is abundant all over the school  students are highly involved  with     organizations to choose from  furthermore  athletic activity does not deprive or distract students from being focused academically on their degree  there are also training and exercise facilities  personally  i have not yet begun to live at the university  so i do not know of the quality of equipment  but the students and staff talk about it with much enthusiasm as far as i know there virtually is no drug scene at ut arlington  so much so that i don t believe alcohol is even permitted at house parties  though i do believe the possible drug scene heavily depends on who you spend your time with but as a whole there really isn t one on campus night life is pretty good  throughout the semester there are numerous activities that both students and guests can attend  there really aren t a lot of house parties and alcohol isn t really allowed at the house parties that do take place we have several extremely high ranked club sports and the athletic facilities are amazing  we have this very large athletic club area called the mac that is free to all currently enrolled students  the mac quite literally has every exercise machine you could possibly think of  also at the fast majority of club meets there is always a heavy fan base of students present there are numerous different types races and religious groups on the campus  but what s so nice about that is that no one particular group is held higher or put on a pedestal  the school is really all inclusive i love arlington because i have lived here my whole life  the area around uta is really growing and becoming like it s own little town  the restaurant and bar options are growing and more places are available to us to live in as well  plus  the close proximity to dallas and fort worth is great for when we want to do something different finding an internship was much easier than i expected  because the business school puts on a job fair each semester and provide amble opportunities to prepare  the process went really well  as a marketing major  i was offered several internship opportunities before making my final decision  i got great pay and wonderful experience during my time as an intern this summer  i just wish more people took advantage of the job fair  business students really do have the upper hand in this situation because we constantly hear about and are preparing for it there are lots of parking spots on campus  because i take morning classes  i never have trouble finding a good spot  when i get out of class in the afternoon  there are almost no spots open for those just now coming to class lots of accessibility in many areas on campus  the connection is good and there are always helpful people around to troubleshoot any problems you may have  the wifi is nice and i usually don t have any problem using my laptop on campus lots of students are involved but we need more spirit to support the teams there is transportation to go all around the campus  yet there is no transportation from other near by cities like fort worth for those that do not drive  yet i hope to take my visual communications major and go into non profit advirtisment  freelancing all the way  of course at uta there at all types of people  this is the most diverse campus i have ever seen  when you arrive you wonder how all of these people get along but then the longer you are there the more you feel and see the joy uta brings to all of these people  it is like it brings all of these random people together just because the ones who dont t fit any where else fit here this school is located by many restaurants  many are even in walking distant  the number of after school activities offered by the clubs here are unfathomable  there s almost always an event you could attend each day after review many professors online  i ve come to a conclusion that many of the professors are quite difficult  but all in all  they do prepare us for the future  you learn everything you need to know for the exams as long as your pay attention  registration was a long process due to the many applicants  but there are many people who will share a common major as you so finding study groups are quite easy  this school offers many after school tutoring programs as well  your understanding and success in this school is their number one priority i have yet to attend this school  but i ve had over    family members attend this school themselves  i ve learned the workload is pretty high  but you learn a lot  there are plenty of job opportunities on campus as well  and programs offered are excellent the school is relatively clean  the social atmosphere is great  there s always new people you can meet and a lot of friendly people  the cost of tuition isn t too high either  it s located near lots of small restaurants practically in walking distance a melting pot of colorful characters and intriguing personalities  uta is a school to be imitated when it comes to incorporating a diverse student body into its campus  african americans  asians  whites  middle easterners  and indian transfer students all occupy the same space  not to mention the variety of religions that the aforementioned students adhere to  the only shortcoming is that the different groups tend to keep to their own interests and majors  limiting interaction between people not much of a nightlife  homecoming seems to be the only social event of the schoolbecause i feel like the buildings aren t super close  weather should result in a little bit of leniency for classes because it s still hugely a commuter school  there isn t a lot of student life after hoursthe dorms a really nice and clean   yeah  they are quite expensive  but your getting every bit of your moneys worth at the dorms at uta they will go above and beyond to help you with whatever you need   and i love that this college has a decent tolerable level of strictness   i don t have a problem with it at all uta is very diverse  it has students from more than    countries attending the school  everyone and their culture is accepted  we even have international week where the different culture clubs can show off their country of origin greek life is apart of uta  but it does not dominate the social scene of the campus  students can attend frat parties  but you don t feel left out if you don t attend i feel very safe here  the campus police are always around and just make everyone feel safe  there are several emergency call centers for students in emergency cases  its a small environment that just makes everyone feel at home  still lock your doors and hide your belongings the facilities here at the university of texas   arlington are absolutely amazing  everything is fairly new and they look so nice  the athletic center or mac is amazing  a great place to hang out and excellent work out facility  the library has multiple floors to study at and tons of computers to use  the university center is cool place to visit and has a billiards and bowling alley to hang out and have fun public transportation is fairly easy around arlington  there are buses to help you get around and a lot of things are in walking distance  transportation is just very accessible here the new event center is amazing  the mac   maverick activities center   is a great place to hang out  study  and work out  it even has a mini convenience store  it practically has everything in one place  except a room to sleep in  the facilities are fairly new and look amazing  everyone here is so friendly and making friends is so easy  i went to the university of houston last year and this school completely surpasses my pass university  i love it greek life is pretty average  people aren t really stuck up about being in a frat so the parties are cool too the dorms are pretty diverse and walking around campus you will see every race so it s pretty normal  people are not isolated because of ethnicity i love my academic partnership  i am able to complete all coursework online while working full time as a teacher and taking care of my family i found the process quite easy  they have admission specialists who walk you through each and every step  making sure you have all the correct paperwork filled out  the only challenge i faced was getting my gre scores to them  i took the gre in the    s and apparently the year i took it  the scores were only reportable for   years  i had to drive to the school      hours away  and take my original score report  it was a miracle i still had it after all these years ive never had an internship  but im pretty sure they would be greatits pretty good  i enjoy it because it is my passion i just wish there were so many conditions to entering the college  i am happy with it  there are some great teachers  my goals are solely to finish school with great grades  my concern about finding a job is the salary and how unexperienced id be at it as far as transportation at ut arlington i really cannot speak on  i have a car  i used to use the shuttles but they would always be late so i stopped texas weather is university of texas at arlington weather so i would say it is unpredictable and that is unfortunate  my allergies are extreme in the spring  winters are fairly reasonable but people from texas cannot drive in inclement weather including rain  fall is perfect here i am a psychology major and it is fairly easy for me  i suppose the reasoning behind this is because i think about things in a very objective way and you need to be objective as a counselor which is what my goal is to be the academic opportunities offered at the university of texas at arlington are endless  you can major and minor in numerous subjects  there are numerous professors that you can choose from and as far as registering for your classes you can choose morning classes  evening classes  or even online courses  most students use a combination of both  i am a psychology major and i have one year left to get my bachelors the modern languages department is great  you get to know your professors very well and they are easy going as well  they are strict and demanding but very easy people to talk to  it is a very small community allowing for you to get to know practically all the students in the modern languages department uta campus life is awesome  they have a little bit of everything  the clubs and greek life of so diverse and fun  also the food  is excellent a lot of choices uta gave me the money i needed and i am happy with the process because it is easy  just fill the fafsa out and submit and they take care of everything else  the maverick promise grant for those with family income less than         ends up paying for     of tuition  the rest you can pay with scholarships  and maybe end up getting a refund  you may not have to pay a dime and end up getting paid to go to school i really wish there was public transportation  arlington has no buses  hardly any sidewalks  bike lanes are few and in between  you wont be getting around much if you don t have a car of your own or catch a ride with friends  walking can only get you so far  campus dining is great  there is a variety of food options and there s also healthy choices athletics are amazing here  you will never be bored at this campus it s hard to find parking in the middle of the day  you have to arrive early just to park in a good spot love this school  there are resources everywhere and the teachers are willing to help uta is very nice actually  i went there for   semester and plan to go back in a bit after some classes i m finishing and i ve never seen anything wrong t all  the environment is clean and good  you don t feel odd anywhere on campus  everyone has there own worries the area around campus is growing and it is easy to find chain restaurants  as well as  some family owned restaurants  chipotle  freebirds  panera  are among my favorites around campus  there is many more though as a day student i feel safe walking around the campus  however  if i had classes that ended in the evening then i would feel less safe walking to my car and class  also  being a male  i feel that i am less likely a target then my fellow female students  the campus is nice but the surrounding area of central arlington has some neighborhoods that definitely have a higher crime rate then where i live  the security alert system sends out emails and texts when there is a threat on campus and it is great system the central library is an awesome resource  however  the science education center  which is a computer lab i frequent  needs some major upgrades when it comes to printing and computer space  but mostly the printing there is frustrating  it is worth it to walk to the library to find a computer and print off documents there buses come by every         minutes  there are scheduled intervals but the buses are normally early or late  which makes waiting for them a gamble and it is always quicker to walk to class  late night transportation is good  call the police office and they will have a golf cart come pick you up and take you to where you need to go on campus great nursing program  one of the best in the country there is a wide variety of people here  being in the dallas fort worth metroplex  with everyone from kids straight from high school  older student returning to college  international students and transfer students  looks range all over the board the computers labs are easily accessible and user friendly on campus transport is wonderful and the dart bus line recently extended their reach to the uta campus  so it is connected to the entire metroplex sometimes it feels like there really isn t much of a social life available for students not in a frat or sorority  sure  if you leave campus  but there are not many school organizations as popular as the greeks  however  there is still a large percentage of non greek students  so even if greek life isn t for you there s still plenty of friends to hang out with most people assume the students who go to uta are either rich white kids or lower class african americans  but that s definitely not the case  arlington is such a diverse community that it shows on campus honestly  the dorm life at uta isn t that great for underclassmen  however  the on campus apartments are newly renovated and incredible  they are clean  spacious and affordable the sun is always shining on our campus  summer lasts until november  and then we enjoy two wonderful weeks of autumn before it turns blistery cold for winter  it never gets cold enough to snow  though it is a safe place  just do not wander alone at night music education is fantastic at uta  the music program is growing and gaining strength consistently  we have excellent faculty that devote a lot of time and study to improving your experience as a music student  if i have one tip to say to a future music student is rnrnget to know your professors    they will write your recommendation letters  help you tutor you  music theory  ear training  music history   and they love to help you get better at whatever subject they teach rnrnwe have incredibly faculty permits are too expensive  dorms don t have enough spaces  typically lots are too far away from buildings  you don t need a car to get across campus  it s much less efficient rnrnit s incredibly difficult to find a parking space within an ample amount of time if you are a commuter  because everyone commutes  rnrnthe parking garage is shared with the church across the street  and is typically too inconvenient to use  lots of money was spent on trying to improve the parking situation  but little to no progress has been made rnrnbeware  however  if you park anywhere incorrectly or improperly  or even sometimes correctly  you will get a fine very quickly campus is very safe  i have walked alone at night  and there is almost nothing that is relatively dangerous  other than perhaps doug russell park  which i don t recommend walking in at night rnrncampus police works wonders when an emergency is spotted  sometimes maybe even in an exaggerated sense  in the dormitories  emergencies  are spotted regularly and people are evacuated because someone burned popcorn  however this is better than the opposite  a lack of communication rnrnthe communication the police department has is fantastic  mymav alerts work quickly and efficiently when there are potential dangers  escorts are typically available and arrive within a decent window of time rnrnyes improvements could definitely be made  but in general campus is very safe at uta ethnicity diversity is great  there is a different ethnicity in almost every corner  we have predominantly white population  but it s almost unnoticeable due to the amount of diverse cultures and backgrounds you can find on campus  economic background is also diverse  there are some financial extremes  such as high spenders and people with very low financial resources  for the most part the majority is middle class to low  as far as political beliefs  the school has a strong mix of conservatives and liberals  just like with economic background  there are extremes  but most fall in the middle  lastly   although i am not part of it  i have heard we have a pretty awesome lgbt community the dorms are geared towards everyone   there is a diverse atmosphere   everything is accessible to the dorms   everything is within walking distance being an international business major at uta is more or less like being two different majors  you re being double dipped  half in a foreign language program and half in a normal business program  there s the obvious business implication but then you re being exposed to a completely different culture it s texas so the weather can be very volatile at times  hot one day cold the next in repetition can be really annoying especially when you thought it was time to put away your big heavy coat one week when its been    degrees only for that one last cold front to come through and change the game once again there s a wealth of degree programs available especially in the math and sciences but there are a lot of opportunities especially in cultural focuses that are being missed by the school there is no public transportation besides the campus shuttle  which helps a lot but you have to keep up with the times  late at night the campus police is always available as well as the golf cart people there are more newly built residence halls that overly exceed expectations of the typical  dorm room   the older buildings  however  do need improvements  all of the residence halls are close enough to campus and all classes  walking is not an issue there is a large variety of majors including ones that can be taken solely online  i love uta as well as the professors and courses there s plenty of security escorts at ut arlington  crime still happens  but it s at a small rate ut arlington just finished building a new dorm and a new strip of restaurants with plenty of variety  there s a sport s grill  a mediterranean restaurant  vietnamese restaurant  a sandwich shop  a frozen yogurt shop all on that strip  the prices are a little high for me  but i m cheap  nothing unreasonable though the clubs in arlington aren t bad  however  you could save yourself money and go to an equally fun house party especially if you re underage   on the plus side  if you get bored in arlington  there s always a nightclub to go to in dallas honestly  texas weather in general is bipolar so you never know what to expect  from my experience  north texas has a little more variety than my hometown in central texas  sometimes  in the winter  it will snow in the morning so be prepared  then the next day  the sun will be shining like nothing happened the day before  just be prepared for all four seasons of the year in one week so far  all of the instructors i ve had for my major have been really nice and understanding  because there are so few communication technology majors at uta  it makes it easier to connect with them and ask them questions  as opposed to a lot of the more popular majors as a communication technology major  it s difficult to find class times to accommodate being able to work and go to school  there are so few of us that they only offer one class time per class  but despite that  i definitely wouldn t change my major  i love web design  and i aim to be successful at it and make it a career  i have no concerns being able to find a job as a web designer  as long as i keep my grades up and get internships along the way as a communication technology major  an internship is pretty much a must if i want to get into the field  i do indeed plan on getting an internship next summer   i d say my dream internship would be at bnsf it s really hard to go to class when you re just one in a million  uta is such a huge campus and it s really difficult to get one on one time with the professor  not to mention all of the campus crime bulletins they put out every two weeks or so  for example  one night at my work study job  there were gunshots fired across the street  needless to say  i ll be trying harder next semester   i m aiming for a     the amount of diversity at uta is crazy   in a good way  i like that i am being exposed to a vast amount of different cultures rather than just one  i believe each person i encounter from a different culture provides a different viewpoint on life being a nursing major at uta is definitely difficult but extremely worth it  when you first start as a pre nursing major it seems like you are competing against hundreds of other girls for less than two hundred spots  turns out you re right  but along the way i have realized that this competition results in only the best making the cut  this means that once i do graduate from uta  my alma mater will say a lot about how qualified i am as a nurse the athletics at uta were great at some points  the men s basketball team did very well almost winning a conference championship again  the women s team had a down year but they will be back  track and field did pretty well also and the baseball softball teams had good seasons ut arlington has helpful resources for all students to succeeduta is a commuter school that brings people from all corners of society  it is pretty diverse from what i see the computer labs are not bad  but i wish we had a printing quota based on the fees we have paid instead of the pay as you go system currently established at the university i don t really hear about a huge drug scene on campus  so i might be in the minority on this topic when someone enrolls  uta should give more information about enrollment it is excellent  the registration is well organized and neat i like the parking except sometimes the parking gets full so quickly i received a decent amount of money  however  i have gotten less money from the previous year  if you receive grants  you must be aware that they change yearly depending on your income and how much money they have  i would suggest to apply to as many scholarships as you can most of the food options are fast food  some include  mcdonalds  wendy s  kfc  taco bell  all of these are within    minutes walking distance and maybe less than   minutes in a car  a favored restaurant near uta is bethany s  it is asian food  like fried rice and chicken  you can also buy boba parking is very bad here  most of the parking spots have a big section just for faculty and staff and most of them are empty  if you dare park there you will receive a ticket  the nearest parking spots are always full  you would have to get there before   am to get a good parking spot arlington has many parks that include trails for biking and hiking  it is very stress relieving to take a walk every once in a while  arlington also has six flags over texas  hurricane harbor  the cowboys stadium  and the rangers ballpark  it has much to offer  the atmosphere is very calm and there are many off campus locations that offer student discounts out of all my experiences at this university i ve never had such a worse experience far as roommates  sure enough the cops  and authorities at campus keep the external problems of campus  but what goes on  on the inside of dorms sometimes between rooms mates can horrid  i ve had a total of three roommates  marijuana smokers  and drunks  even though i specifically answered the housing survey denying i did neither one of these things i still got placed with said implications  which others gladly took part in  this campus needs checks to be made between the residents dorms as the weather if often usubject to change just about anywhere due to human interaction or just the natural flow of mother nature the weather far as i recall was often stable  true enough there were cold nights  some unnecessary because of roommates were messing with the thermostat  or left the window open overnight  but there was nothing that truly affected my campus experience being a slightly picky eater i often found myself having to succumb to new things  the school did okay in serving a decent quality  i suppose  although it did get tiring  because one could expect the same thing periodically   in retrospect i appreciated how they remodeled the waffle station  it really showed to me they re thinking of change  because first semester it was a wait  and if a mess between each person using the waffle iron  secondly as the staff was generally nice  and the whole setup of the dinning i felt it could do more to bring out the potentially especially in the dinning meal plans in all honesty being a freshman there s alot of dorms at the university of arlington that aren t new  a general amount of them are slightly more shabbier than others depending what side you decide to live on  my freshman year i stayed in the oldest  yet cheapest place on the lot  ie  brazos   the social life was better than the last dorm i previously moved in from  the ras were thorough  they tried to get students involved  but in all the architecture f the building was somewhat horrid  i lived on the fourth floor and carrying stacks of dorm room supplies back  and forth can be a hassle next to having to dodge the pipes running out the walls  while the lighting was fairly well unlike some of the more expensive dorms  far as amenities  and bug control there wasn t any issues computer labs are always busy during finals times  but that is to be expected anywhere   the reason i give the grade a b  is that during these times the speed of which the wifi acts really slows down and can make work frustrating there s a large variety of majors to choose from at uta  you ll will find your match no doubt and succeed with all the help uta offers the nightlife at uta is good  there s always something to do and some places don t close until   every night the crime on campus is definitely taken care of by the campus police  i feel safe walking by myself on campus i love living on campus  i was hardly ever late to class and i didn t have to worry about parking  everyone was real friendly and i met so many people  the rooms were comfortable and it was a reasonable price  i m going to miss living on campus parking on campus is a challenge   it is difficult to find parking close to class   be prepared to walk    or more minutes to class   on campus housing is a   to    minute walk to class  while off campus housing requires a car as there is no public transportation  a parking permit for the spring and both summer sessions cost       campus police are constantly checking cars for permits and parking violations new  small restaurants have been built on campus  but eating places outside of campus are pretty bland and boring  within a   mile radius of uta  we have a few chicken places  a taco bell  chipotle  and of course  a mcdonald s i always have to ask for extra funds because the amount i m awarded is never enough to cover my classes  not including books  getting through to the financial aid office is also a difficult task  the phone lines are always busy and the wait time can be as long as    minutes i see a lot of greek life booths and set ups  but they aren t really active  otherwise  i dont see a lot of partying going on at uta campus food is only good for the first semester but arlington has tons of places you can dineat uta  the academia is amazing  the classes are great but very challenging  they make you work for your degree  one you have be proud of when you finish uta is great  though the campus is local they still uphold the university to a tier   status arlington is the mecca of entertainment  along with the university  it has six flags over texas  texas rangers ballpark  dallas cowboys stadium  and six flags hurricane harbor  with dallas only    minutes away  the students have alot of activities to fill up their free timeit s a college campus  so obviously drugs and alcohol are present  however  there are rarely arrests on campus for possession charges and the occasional ticket for alcohol on campus is written during a weekend party  uta is technically a tobacco free campus  but people can be found smoking in dark alleys with little consequence  all in all  drugs and alcohol are not really a problem  except in rare instances the computers have up to date hardware  and windows   is stable enough to work on all of the units  the internet connection speeds are great  and wifi is available inside all buildings  and within approximately    feet outside buildings  even at peak times there are usually computers available  although sometimes it can be a hassle to wait for someone that is clearly using the computer for recreational use  rather than school or professional work as a double major in criminal justice and german language i find myself looking at dozens of options as far as advising help goes  all of my professors have experience in the fields that they are teaching about  and many of my german instructors are german born  making the learning experience that much more realistic after studying biomedical engineering my first two semesters  i decided to change my direction  double majoring in criminal justice and german language in the hopes of getting a job in the federal government  cia  fbi  atf  etc   i loved the engineering classes  they were very hands on and engaging  but i realized that i wanted to do something more adventurous than research  i have only received what appears to be computer generated responses from the cia  which can be frustrating  but the career center is helping me get more information as i go through the semesters except for the occasional flash flood in the spring semester  north texas weather is relatively stable  the temperature can fluctuate    degrees from day to day  but other than that there are relatively few occasions where inclement weather affects the operation of the school one thing that uta has going for it  is its diverse population of students  many of the clubs  groups  and organizations  represent many of the different kinds of students who attend uta  i still remember how at freshman orientation  one of the major topics covered was promoting diversity and acceptance there is a wide variety of off campus housing to choose from at uta  it is relatively easy to sign up  and some of the leases offered are flexible  however  a lot of them can be quite expensive i m currently majoring in accounting at uta  accounting can be a pretty difficult major  and the workload can be stressful  however the curriculum is pretty straightforward  it s just a lot to learn remember  the college of business does offer tutoring opportunities for those that require them  but the tutoring offered for upper level classes isn t free  the accounting director does email links to various accounting internship job opportunities through affiliates of uta as far as uta s student life is concerned  there is definitely room for improvement  the university center is in desperate need of renovation  with the amount of students that attend uta on a regular basis  the university center seems small and easily becomes very crowded  the maverick activity center  uta s athletic center  offers great services facilities  but is located on a very inconvenient part of campus  where parking is extremely difficult to find  with the majority of students being commuters  and with the fast paced nature of classes  the best way to meet people make friends is by joining clubs at uta  uta does offer a variety of clubs  but you have to make the effort to inquire at places like the university center  and keep and eye out for their activities on campus  the clubs and activities on campus  are welcoming but not as accommodating for commuter students for the most part  the professors are pretty reasonable  the majority that i ve encountered are available outside of class  and have been willing to answer any questions that i ve had about the course material  as i ve gone further into my major  the workload has picked up  and being able to properly manage my time has become very important  the average amount of classes that i ve taken each semester at uta is five  the various exams that i ll have to take during a semester tend to occur around the same time  either during the same day  or within days of each other  in order to register for classes  you have to meet with an academic adviser for your  intended  major  it is very important to sign up as early as possible  the classes of favored professors are quickly fill up  so the sooner you sign up the better    percent of the students commute to school  many of the students that one will are returning to college to continue their education  the university of texas at arlington  uta  is very diverse in regards to both the various ethnicities and age groups of the university s students  however  because the majority of students at uta are commuters  it can be somewhat difficult to connect with other students and make friends  also  school spirit is something that is lacking at uta  although some of the students are able to rally support for some of the other sports such as basketball  the lack of a football team reduces the presence of school spirit the drug scene isn t a big issue  the only thing that needs more enforcement is the smoking around campus  but besides that everything else is relatively nonexistent the guys and girls at uta are pretty unique  there are so many different kinds of people with different cultures  styles  and interests  i really haven t seen or met anyone with huge egos so i can just simply say that uta is a chill campus and is certainly more appealing than what i orginally thought  i m glad i picked this school i don t live on campus but it looks good from the outside i ve visited one of the rooms and i loved it there s always some meeting or event where free or heavily discounted food is served  the organizers of these events are very good at getting the word out via student email or flyers signs around campus for the most part the campus is well kept and some of the new facilities are amazing especially the new engineering building but there s a significant disparity between the old and the new  i wish they would bring some of the older buildings up to par i am not a part of greek life at uta  however almost all of my friends are in a sorority or a fraternity  all of my friends who are a part of greek life are wonderful people  they are very caring and studious  they can manage their time well  and most of them also have a job  they market their philanthropy very well so the non greek students know how they are impacting the community  i would say that non greeks don t view greeks as any different  i know greek housing is available but i don t know any specific details about greek housing because i am not a part of greek life i tend to focus more on my academics than on varsity sports  but i have been to a handful of varsity games  the teams are very energetic and try to build up crowd enthusiasm  which does work  i am a member in uta s club tennis team and almost     people are a part of or are interested in joining club tennis  club tennis definitely shows school spirit wherever we go  we make the maverick name known wherever we go  we practice hard and compete hard  we are a close team  the uta varsity tennis team has helped with club tennis drills in the past and they always encourage people to come out to the tennis matches  students at uta are working on our school spirit uta is the best school in the world  uta is so diverse that it is a representation of the world  i ve met countless people who just moved to america a week before school started  everyone is so friendly regardless of where they grew up  what language they speak  and what culture they come from  the culture at uta is so unique that it can t be found anywhere else  everyone has such a passion to succeed and thrive in their desired area of expertise  becoming a maverick has been the best decision of my entire life  i couldn t picture myself at any other college or university  i ve made lifelong friends that i couldnt image living without  everyone at uta is so welcoming and encouraging  i meet someone new every day  the maverick way is the best way  go mavs i am here for slp and they have a good reviewall the professors are passionate about their work and create a great learning atmosphere i feel safe everywhere i gothe only bad part is on move in day there is a lot of cleaning to be done there so many choices that fit all sorts of personalities the athletic department is awesome because both campus and town are really involved  flags go up faces are painted  and overall just a great family friendly environment i attend the university of arkansas  the academics are great with professors who are understanding  passionate  and genuinely care about your success  in addition  they offer many diverse organizations to help you get connected and feel right at home it is a great school with a diverse community probably the most diverse school i ve ever seen it s definetly around  but that s any college for you i have so really small classes that require lots of presentations  then i have few big classes  professors are more lecture lecture lecture there are definetly better schools where a degree from there would be a lot better  but that being said its not a bad place to get your degree the schools not in the greatest part of town  so you definitely have to look out they look like decent dorms  but i live off campus as do most since this is a commuters college i like that the fraternity s are a lot more chill here then they are at other schools we don t have a football team  but if we did it would probably increase the school spirit toward athletics a lot i love how friendly everyone is  and how easy it is to have fun here there are so many different races  religions  ethnicities  and cultures of people at uta  that s actually one of things we re known best for  being diverse  what s great is that there s a place for everyone  whether you choose to stick to your own kind  or if you prefer to mix it up  everyone can interect together without conflictuta has a huge amount of scholarships  there are general admission scholarships for entering freshman and for transfer students  and there are a lot of scholarships within the departments  in engineering there are general engineering scholarships  but there are aslo some from each engineering discipline such as civil  mechanical  electrical  ect  the honors college has a lot of funding available  including a full ride that covers tution  fees  books  housing  and meal plans  though they have a lot available  uta is very large and diverse so scholarships are very competitive i wish there were more scholarship options that are not restricted based on first generation college students  i feel like too much is assumed just because you had one parent get a degree from college  hence  you are no longer eligible to apply for it  i am    now and still trying to complete school  having to pay for everything through loans and barely any grant or scholarship money from what i hear  on campus housing is suffice and is reasonable the options are fine  but i typically buy food from the grocery stores to save money i would have like to have known that i exhausted my undergraduate funding i am not very social at my school  i love uta campus  i think its beautiful  from what i do notice  uta is extremely diverse  black  white  asian  indian  females  males  gay  straight  you also have the art crowd  theater crowd  the jocks  the greek crowd  and the brains every bar i know about on cooper street is basically a hole in the wall  my friends and i go to dallas whenever we want to go out for a drink or to dance  if we want to go somewhere more low key we usually go to the arlington highlands to an upscale bar i received a decent amount of my financial aid but there was not that much after paying for classes and fee to go towards textbooks  not that much money left over to save  i also do not like the fact that we only receive financial aid only a couple of day before school  students need more time to purchase books  help with living expenses  and ultimately be more prepared for the upcoming semester fair  teachers are very good though  for the most part the computer labs are definitely are huge help especially when my own computer is acting up  plus the labs have tons a resources like being able print out things and check out certain things the academics overall are above average in terms of the curriculum given  i would rate it an a as many of the professors in various subjects are very well engaging and actually help you enrich your mind and inspire you to persevere in whatever major you are in  in terms of workload  if a college student is aspiring for the minimal amount  then this is the wrong school as many professors expect you to complete work outside of class as practice  the facilities are decent on campus the athletic facilities are newly constructed and very much world class  however  campus support for the professional college teams such as basketball is not as celebrated compared to other universities  team performance for the sports are average as well everyone at the school are pretty nice   if they know that you are new they will go out their way to make you feel accepted and comfortable  most of them are really carefree and just worried about their grades so they are really smart but at the same time they know how to have fun i dont really see anybody that is using drugs and if they are then they hide it really good everything has been newly remodeled with a new mac center for uta students as well as a massive   story library that allows students to check out from uta as well as neighboring arlington libraries definitely a nice campus will various resources  the library is open    hours during the week of finals  also the lounges offer plenty of seating spaces as well as quiet places for studying never can tell with texas weather one day it will be sunny the next it will be thunderstorms and the next day you will have a    degree temperature drop  in the spring and summertime the heat picks up it can make those walks to class feel like eternity if you may or may not know texas weather is bipolar  one day it could be really hot and the next day cold and windy  another day it could be nice outside and in a matter of hours it can be raining cats and dogs  just be prepared for texas weather the dorms are good  i live in vandergriff which are the newest dorms that opened in the fall of       the other dorms are nice and there are a variety of styles many students commute to school so this isn t set up like a tradition university  there isn t as much activities  clubs  or parties  most students however feel as if education is very important  the guys are a variety of mixes and the girls  including my girlfriend  are pretty hot all of my professors have been very knowledgeable  i have learn a lot in the past year and i feel really excited about my future education here  i feel very comfortable with the workload  because the way it is presented is usually in a straightforward  easy to understand way our campus is a tobacco free campus  i don t ever see any illegal activity on campus the greek life isn t so big here  they are always out on campus selling things but they all seem to stay to themselves there are several different groups of restaurants right around campus  a longer drive will provide more  the restaurant range from cheap  american fast food to expensive  authentic  international food  many local places around campus provide student discounts and it s not difficult to find coupons or deals at other stores there are many things to do in arlington as well as taking a    minute drive to several neighboring cities like dallas or ft  worth  there are activities  entertainment  and shopping for any race  age  or economic background  crime in arlington alone isn t bad  the main drawback  though  is the lack of public transportation  if you want to get anywhere  you have to drive yourself  get a cab  or walk  which isn t easy  the drug scene at uta is non existent  if you want to party  uta is not the place for you  all the students are very focused on their education  so even drinking isn t very popular i think the program is pretty good  i would do it over again if i could because i feel more prepared to enter the nursing field after my experience in school  my goal is to continue my education and become a nurse practitioner  and i see myself attending uta for my msn getting into the nursing program at uta is pretty difficult because it is competitive  there are a lot of students that want to get accepted and your pre nursing grades influence your acceptance  you must make a s and have a minimum of   b s in your major sciences in order to get accepted  it sounds tough  but if you manage your time and stay on top of things  it s not impossible  i would recommend studying for the entrance hesi by doing lots of practice questions  that will help you increase your chance of getting accepted i like the nursing program at uta  it s really hard to get in because it s pretty competitive  but utacon has excellent professors that know what they re talking about  i really like the school because i feel like it has prepared me to become a good nurse  i know what to expect when i graduate  the workload is overwhelming at times  but time management is key to stay on top of things  good luck the parking attendants are really strict  make sure you get a parking pass lots of options  some of the bars are a little sketchyfew and far between and the due dates are super early my major is sociology  and the reason i m giving it a b  is because the advisor for sociology is horrible you really have to take initiative and look at the undergraduate student catalog and know for yourself what classes you need to take  the advisor has had students taking classes they didn t need and forgetting to tell students about a class they did need which sucks because some of them were about to graduate  i was fortunate enough to know a guy who is a sociology major and he planned out my whole schedule for me and told me what i need to take and who to take and who not to take because he in may will be a grad student  overall i love my major the teachers are excellent they really know what they are talking about and the classes so far have not been dull  i m excited to take sociology of religion in the fall and the latina experience  my major offers a variety of different courses for you to take and explore i actually don t stay in an off campus apartment but from what i heard stay away from centennial court and maverick place apartments  the crime is horrible  the staff are incompetent and don t care about the residents  their is filth and trash everywhere  if your shower isn t working or you put in a work order good luck trying to get the repair person to come out at a decent time to fix the situation  people have had their bikes stolen  cars etc overall these apartments are not where you want to be stuck in a lease and contract at i would suggest paying more money for a better apartment life at campus edge or midtown uta  the only good thing about the apartments i mentioned are that they are near the campus and parking isn t an issue at the apartments  i gave it a b  rating because their are a ton of apartments and i can t grade all based off the bad apartments the saftey is really outstanding on campus we constantly have cops driving around on the actual walkways on campus throughout the whole day  arlington police and school police are always in the area surrounding the school and also we have a police office right across the street from the campus built in next to the vandergriff dorms and parking garages  they are right near the new school restaraunts also  their are emergency call phones and buttons around campus so theirs really not much of a saftey concern to me and when something does occur police put out flyers and email students to alert them of current events  i would still recommend protecting yourself and your assets  so lock your doors don t walk around late at night by yourself  walk in big groups with people you trust etcthe main reason i came to ut arlington was because the school really does care about the students  they work hard to provide us with entertainment such as drake  rick ross  etc every year  they offer various type of living and housing options and the option to have a meal plan to access the cafe and fast food places  most of the students who do i tern ships their senior year and if they do good get the job right off the back with no problem  ut is a top nursing school and     of the nurses get a job at a hospital or medical center  the environement and atmosphere is laid back and chill  overall ut is a great school the weather is also so up in the air  no pun intended  when it comes to texas  it is hot one day and cold the next  it makes it hard to attend events because you don t always dress properly for them or they may be postponed due to unforseen circumstances there is a huge amount of diversity at uta  different cultures all over campus you can go to just about anything you want  arlington has any kind of food  best burgers      airway burgers across from cowboys stadium on collins it s improving every year  but it had such a late start that is expected  basketball games are fun i felt like all the professors had a great knowledge of the subjects i received some nice scholarships from the school  it was an easy process i got quality education  also felt prepared for when i got into the real world there are computers but it is much easier to just bring your own  sometimes it is hard to connect with wifi but nicer than not having a computer it is hard to get financial aid unless you are not white and not a woman safety in the campus is everywhere  wherever you go  you will feel safe the drug scene at uta is not really big here  it can also depend on those who you hang out with that does drugs  alcohol is a big thing on campus and many students take part in that during social scenes uta is very diverse when it comes to the ethnic diversity  you can see many different races while walking the campus when there are home games for the athletes  a lot of students show their appreciation for the teams  they make sure that they show every way they can support  simply by dressing up in spirit wear  making posters  and giving away prizes to the audience  i really like how much school spirit there is on campus uta will send you text messages and emails of any issues on the campus   they send periodic tests as well to make sure the system is functioning properly uta is an extememly divere university   many countries are represented in the different colleges   uta also provided continuing education for those learning english arlington is a great town   many activities such as the rangers  the cowboys and six flags   good restaurants   uta is a safe and beautiful campus   located between dallas and ft  worth very satisfied with my course and will definitely do it again the only challenge i think is having to take elective courses that don t count towards my major   i am an engineering major  and i have to to take music   rnas an international student  i had to have good sat s and toefl results  lol  no abnormal application processit keeps me engaged when am less busy  it makes me meet new people  it improves my leadership skills and it also improves my teamwork skillsthe teachers send out job posts and opportunities  the school helps you find scholarships  workload is not overwhelming  but prepares you well  everything is close  parkinglots get full fast  but there is a garage you can pay extra if youare running late safety is something to keep in mind wherever you go  there are a lot of houses for rent within walking distance of the school i feel there is a good sports scene   could be improved by involving students in contests or promotions students have been robbed and injured while attending classes the arlington hall ra s are a bunch of kids put in charge to do an adults job  had a horrible experience with the girls above me on the second floor and me and my roommate complained and followed rules yet we were penalized for everything  the girls just kept getting a slap on the wrist and we were being snobbed  rudely greeted from ra s and ignored when calling to complain  i personally got tired of living underneath elephants so i moved to the third floor and my roommate moved to a different dorm hall  it s texas so it s always nice unless it s hellaciously hot most people live throughout arlington and mansfield where housing is cheaper  the apartments closest to the school are terrible  however the new college park center is really nice  and the apartments on the west side of campus are okay traffic is really bad if you are a commuter studentmost dorms are housed by the freshman class  most upper classmen tend to live in the on campus apartments or off campus rncoming in as a freshman this year the dorm experience was pretty average   i share a room and bathroom with one room mate and there s always some kind of activity going on in our dorm lobby   you get to meet a lot of people living in the dorm and you get a meal plan for on campus there are computers all over campus that students have access to rnall you have to have is your student log in and password we are getting more restaurants and things on campus  we do not have a football team so the school is highly involved with the basketball team  and other sports  we have a bowling alley and our gym is awesome  the library is great and the staff is very helpful arlington is a good town  there is a mall down the street and other shopping centers  we are like twenty minutes from both dallas and fort worth  so there are things to do and plenty of places to eat  there is also six flags  hurricane harbor  cowboy stadium and rangers stadium greek life is only    of the population  they are nice people and they have parties and stuff but it s nothing special  there are houses they have but there are only so many rooms in each house freshman do not have to live in dorms  you can live where you want  youll have to apply of course but there is space it s texas  the weather changes a lot  it can be cold one day and bright and shiny the next  but there is usally never any bad weather that will cause classes to be canceled some restaurants have no control over who will take what table or group of peoplegood amount of choices buffet for a good price and sometimes have fun late night food events waffle party at  am new apartments were just built and some even include utilities and fully furnished for a very fair priceyou have to arrive early to get a good spot and it it a long walkif you want diversity  uta is the place to be  there are a variety of peoples whom diversify the atmosphere here  and if you were to seek information about other people  you will find much to learn about our different races  religions  cultures  traditions  political beliefs  etc  however  uta tends to overemphasize their  diversity  without noticing the impact it has onto their student body  sometimes  it feels like uta gives preferential treatment to self segregating  rather than actually unifying the student body  we present our diversity through the use of organizations and events specific to a certain minority  race  or ethnicity  nonetheless  uta is a source of attraction for those who want their college experience flavored with the interaction of ethnic and racial diversity the cafeteria has good food every now and then but overall everything is okay  another option is the plaza that has different foods like chickfila  subway  panda express  etc each department is different but so far every professor is helpful but some give a lot of work but studying on campus is easy  department buildings have study areas and the library is    hours workload is heavy and some of the teachers are hard to understand but many students are helpful and most professors are very helpful also weather is never a factor here  driving to school is simple and if you live on campus it is not hard to get around in the cold or heat parking ticket will for sure be given to those who don t have a parking permit  if you do then parking fills quickly through out the day but the farthest parking lot is in walking distance and some even have shuttles the shuttles run all day  however  sometimes  they combine routes  which makes them run kind of slowly and off schedule  also  some of the drivers drive really slowly and you come really close to being late for class the campus has a strict underage policy about drinking  if you are caught you could be suspended from campus and the cops at uta are actual arlington pd so you could be arrested and charged  my best advice is to just wait till your    and then go to the local bars don t drink underage athletics at uta are a prime way to get involved in campus  the athletes are nice and caring and want people to come out and join  the team performance is generally great  we made it to nationals  school spirit can get a little crazy but its all in good fun are very proactive when comes to crime always touring campus and very active  it is beautiful at uta and if you feel unsafe police will come and escort you to your vehicle or if you are looking to go to your dorm only about two good size computer labs  have to pay for printing    cents a page   wireless network is available all across campus but reliability can be a bit iffy  would be best if you had your own laptop great local places right off campus  but if you want to find the more common restaurants it is about a       minute drive to the highlands the campus is tobacco free which is great   except that you will on ocassion see someone smoking security is top notch  you are never more than one minute from a police call booth and they are all very nice  however  we usually have maybe one mugging every two or three months  but the uta department is usually pretty good about sending a notification for us to know to be careful and not walk around alone at night every off campus housing in the immediate area of uta is terrible and at least a million years old  the only reason they are receiving a c  rather than a triple f is because they just recently built a new complex called the lofts which are actually extremely nice and high end set of apartments right next to campus  they are also very reasonably priced about      a month for a one bedroom and it s very nice  if they renovated the deteriorating apartments it would be so much nicer the safety and security on campus is high  there is a police department right near school  and there are emergency telephone post with a button that can easly be pushed through out campus  if a student feels unsafe  he or she can call a security golf car to come and drop him or her off for free to his or her destination area the computer safety is high and the internet in the computers is fast  there are many places to use computers with a student identification and password  the computers are in good shape and have good software the minimum experience i have with the financial aid department at uta has been relatively painless the counselors are very helpful in walking you through the processyes i do enjoy school  the reason is that it is online and very convenient yes  i am pretty happy with the program because i can do it online  this works well with my schedule  i plan to continue on to my masters in hospital administration as a transfer student  there weren t many scholarships from uta that i qualify for  come in with good grades is the best thing you can do so far i am loving my science classes i am taking for the nursing prereq s  so glad i switched from my previous it major i wouldn t because one of the advisors is hard to deal with one of the advisors is hard to deal with because she hardly does any work  but the classes aren t that difficult  it s not easy enough to slack off alot though the process is pretty much just have enough hours     and you should be able to transition into your desired major  there s also a gpa requirement of      going to the connection cafe  buffet  gets old very fast  the options in the plaza aren t that great quality either  it s hard to change it up for food  so i would rather buy groceries at walmart or kroger walking to class is nice if the weather s decent  i hate to walk in the rain since i don t like being wet  especially in class computers are accessible in the library  second floor is full of computers but be sure to get there early cause they sometimes do get occupied  there are other computers on the first  fourth  floors and some halls have computer rooms  for example  arlington hall  printing can be done in the library too and the programs are up to date the financial aid process was always very confusing to me  my school year total was around    thousand  so it was pretty scary trying to meet deadlines for scholarships  take out loans  and all that to try to meet that money  luckily  i had received a good amount of scholarships  so that helped greatly  but i still had to take out a loan  which you should be careful to check which type of loan you have to pay back with interest and which one is not  i am still a little confused over the whole process and it can sometimes get overwhelming  but as long as you are organized  have some kind of estimate of how much money you will be spending  and start applying for scholarships now  you should be good for when your next semester comes the process to get into the psychology major was relatively easy  i already had a bunch of college credits that i had earned in my high school so i didn t really go through any special application besides them only putting me in social psychology  which is what i needed before i could take other higher level psychology classes  i had to get above a b in that class to be able to be eligible to enter the major s advising network  which i did  but other than that  it went better than expected  now i just have to keep my grades up to be able to maintain my spot in the program there are a lot of fast food restaurants with in walking or   mins driving distance  some even offer a uta disscount if you show them your mav id  fast food places   also you can always go near parks mall where restaurants like razoos  chilis  and many others surround it avoid maple square    i lived there for about three weeks and left because the place was absolutely infested with cockroaches   you could really tell no one really gave a damn about maintenance or cleaning or extermination   i also lived at centennial court for   months   thankfully  it did not have a bug problem  but the maintenance was still pretty shoddy   had cleanliness  water  and internet problems there   the people at centennial court are rowdy and loud too beautiful weather  friendly people  new housing  and some old   lots of study spots knowledgeable professors who care about what they teach  invest in their students and help you out are here  you will find a variety of curriculum  and you can register according to what s most fitting for you  there is plenty of academic help and advising the music program is what made me decide to come here because it is different from other schools  it s all the excellence in education you need  but instead of a cut throat atmosphere there is a supportive community of students and staff who really enjoy each other  instructors are very invested in their students  and the workload is reasonable  some classes are hard  but we have all the help we need  in short  i love it we don t have a football team at all  but our focus is mainly on baseball and basketball  we have an awesome new facility  the college park center  where home basketball games take place  and the games are pretty fun online professors were great about responding to questions in a timely  mannerto be honest  i don t think greek life is a big influence on campus  it exists and that s pretty much it  i don t think the greek students are looked at negatively here there are new restaurants popping up in the college park area that are pretty good but i m hoping they will hurry and finish with the construction so we can have more options ut arlington has a fair amount of culture on campus  the student body is diverse and accepting of people of different cultural backgrounds and sexual orientation being a biology major isn t easy   there is hard work waiting for you but i do love and enjoy all the labs  i am better when working with my hands and seeing it instead of sitting in class or reading a fun experiment out of a book pretty good and most of the teachers i have had so far were fun and awesome  much different than what you would get at high school  there is a whole other level of professionalism and it works with students its good that there is rules to be followed although there are a few  law breakers  but whenever it is serious and students lives are in danger then the right and most discreet action is taken to take care of the situation they are more pricy than colleges i have been to but they are very central and in the middle of all the action on campusi have never had to use the transportation system at school  but from speaking to fellow students that do use it daily  i know they do a good job of having many ways of assisting you  as well as the late night numbers you can call to have someone go and pick you up wherever you are and take you where needed  this is a great safety precaution i received a good amount of financial aid  and it has usually been a pretty smooth process  i ve never had to go in person to the office  sending in forms has been fairly simple they can be kind of dirty since a lot of people use them  there are periods of time where they re filled with people using them  and sometimes it s frustrating when people use them for unnecessary things like facebook or youtube when others need it for school  the network reliability is average and the speed is average  printing wasn t very clearly explained and i had to have a friend explain to me how the system works  while it may be convenient to use your mavid  i think alternate options such as using coins would be a much easier alternative for someone who needs a print on the go there are a lot of opportunities  when i have a chance i will apply yes because there are opportunities here i did not know about until i enrolled  plus they take care of their science and math majors  giving us the best toys the application went very smoothly without a hitch there are so many resources and help to get one through this weird thing called college life the weather is wonderful   it occasionally is cold and it has rained a few times but it s usually nice outside  makes it easier to get up and go to class the campus is really nice   it s safe and the police keep people in line here in south arlington  where i reside  are many things to get into  the new cowboys stadium  the parks mall  and many restaurants are very close to me  shopping is never a hard task here  there are many shops and stores nearby as well  just on the edge between grand prairie and arlington are the paragons  it is a new strip mall filled with great stores and food court most of the guys at uta are sweet gentlemen  i m taken and am no way in need but i guess you could say the men are attractive here too  the girls are pretty nice as well  surprisingly  the guys are actually nicer and more outgoing  there is a lot of diversity on campus  different groups  cultures  religions  etc  i enjoy associating with the many different people on campus  they re fun to learn from there are plenty of computers at the library  you can always at least find one open  if not they have computers in other on campus locations  either way there is wifi in every building on campus  which makes it very convenient if you have a laptop ipad tablet  not owning your laptop will be no problem what so ever ut arlington has access to plenty of off campus housing  the community is continuing to grow and more housing is being built as we speak  there are available apartments  rental homes  and even condos around the campus area  there is somewhere to live for everyone is there an astronautical branch for aerospace engineering  if so  what are the requirements for acceptance into the school and  how much would the overall cost be   the basketball teams are the high light on campus  but i wish we had football six flags and hurricane horbor are really close to the school  also cowboy stadium better know what you are doing because if not you will become a victim quick you can t do anything fun  people complain and it is too strict  do not come here if you are looking for a fun time in college though there are no public transportation in arlington   there are on campus buses that take you around the whole campus   it  is a large campus  so having a bus is very helpful   the bus drivers are very helpful as well if you didn t know where you were going there are a few dining options   they are good but pricey uta takes pride in being a tobacco free campus   you cannot smoke and carrying other drugs are  out of the question   it is a very safe campus living in texas  the weather is mostly hot all the time or mild and the campus rarely shuts down for inclement weather issues  there has only been one or two times in the last few years where classes were canceled  and that was because of severe ice on the roads or snow the campus has many buses and bus stops around campus that students can use to get around  walking isn t a problem for me though and there are lots of parking lots around campus that to me  makes the transportation obsolete unless you happen to have to park at a lot that is far away from where most of your classes are uta s facilities are top notch  i started on the campus back in      and there has been nothing but additions and improvement across campus  i love the activity center where i can go work out for free and i love all the new food place additions to the campus that have come recently  the new college park district is top notch  and attracted many great restaurants and places to hang out  overall  i love the campus  and wish i did more things on campus and went to more activites and used more the facilities on campus then i actually do i think the night life is alright but the university lacks a central district to hang out and bar hop  it would be nice to make an area that has the feel of  th street  north gate or fry street  examples of drinking rows near other universities in the state people of all races  languages  backgrounds  and creeds attend the university of texas at arlington make all a s in pre requisite courses  discuss degree plan with a counsellor in person  don t try to figure it out on your own i would reccommend an intership to any nursing graduate  i was able to train directly into the er with no experience  the pay is low and i had to sign a   year contract  but  i am doing what i wanted to do and have more experience in   year as many floor nurses get in    years it s so boring here  there isn t much public transportation or activities on campus  everyone keeps to themselves  the shopping centers are far away  there aren t many events  and i m scared of wandering off campus at night since someone gets robbed or beat up every week there is a lot of variety in ethnicity  which is good  but most of them really aren t that interesting or attractive  i m more into more artistic  geeky or intelligent types  there aren t that many here  however  they tend to be hardworking and athletic there are some good options  but i get tired of all the asian food on campus  however  there are new restaurants near the new dorms that are nice  but are expensive they are expensive  but there are some nice options that allow you to split the cost between people  however it is difficult to get them due to high demand coming to the point of local atmosphere its nevertheless better compared to other universities based on safety and other thingswe dont have such good transportation facility as it is a small town i am not so happy with my major  i do not get to choose classes and professors i like when it comes to my major classes  fortunately  the teachers here are quite knowledgeable i feel like home here  there are tons of organizations on campus for you to choose from  the student center is nice and offers a lot of activities each day  social life in uta is not bad at all  go check it out they make it very easy to navigate on the mymavs student center website  everything comes itemized and clear of awarded aid loans  be sure to take care of all your financial needs as early as possible arlington is a terrific town with lots to do  especially so since it consists of large attractions such as rangers stadium  the cowboys stadium  hurricane harbor and six flags  it is relatively safe  provides lots of nightlife and dining dining options  is easy to navigate  and has a mix of people of various ages the campus has a diverse crowd in terms of cultural diversity and lifestyles  it doesn t seem hard to meet new people since it is a bustling place and eager minds are all here for the same purpose  given the new eat drink shop additions  it provides more places for entertainment amongst each other there are several options for dining now  the newer dorm area has lots of selection from frozen yogurt  burgers  pho and sandwiches it s texas  very unpredictable but there is a weather system around campus that warns students  faculty  and staff when there is bad weatherthe basketball games are great  but they need a football team it can be really expensive and really nice or really s    y and cheap  either you are close to campus though uta is known for its diverse student body  every race  black  white  african  hispanic  asian  indian and more is found on this campus on a day to day bases  there are clubs and organizations for each race as well as for the many religions on campus  there are also groups for lbgt and allies such as the gsa  gay straight alliance  everyone has somewhere they can belong to  it is one of the biggest mixture of people i have seen and it works wonderfully  i dont think i would have been happy anywhere else or met as many unique people and made this many interesting friends  from whom i now have a chance to learn about different cultures and beliefsthe fine arts classes for my major in visual communication are great  yes the professors have a the basic rules and guidelines that need to be met  but they let you discover and explore many options  many of the professors if not all of them have worked in the field or still are and are able to give great advice on jobs  internships  and of course the actually work your produce  they are always there to answer questions and offer opinions as to where to to take your project  there are a small amount of vc professors  but you get to create relationships with them which i think is wonderful  i really enjoy my major and my professors uta has a lot of diversity  it s the only campus i ve been on that is not mainly white i have not had any personal run ins with the police on campus  however  i do see plenty of them around  they are everywhere at the rec center  library  walking around  they don t seem to have a god complex or anything  they are just there to keep us safe there are not many shuttle buses that drive around campus  the ones that do dont travel very far around the school is very serious about the honor code the first time a professor turn you in they will not allow the professor to drop your lowest grade  the next time you will be suspended and lastly you ill be exspelled  i am not really sure about the policys in the dorms because i live off campus their are all types of guys and girls at uta ranging from different ethnicity to majors  allowing it to be easy to meet different people in every class and social activity uta is the most diverse campus you will ever see  you can meet people from all over the world  students  faculty and staff greatly appreciates the diversity here well it s texas   so expect bipolar weather  it s freezing one day and next day you are wearing shorts there are many computer labs on campus  you can probably find a spot somewhere  they work fine and the speed is good too  there are also many printers and the cost is not that much  very cheap  if you are an engineering major you get free printing at woolf hall plenty of restaurants to choose from on campus  the sushi and sandwhiches prepared in the cafe are good too lots of things to do around town  close to dallas and fort worth and there s always something going on for everyone it is usually sunny and nice outside for a good   months  the summer s can get pretty high in temperature but some utilize that to tan more and such  if snows classes usually will be cancelled since it doesn t snow much around here arlington itself isn t a very  happening town  but since it s located between dallas and fort worth  you don t have to travel very far to find things to do  sure the cowboys stadium is located here but college kids usually don t have the means to buy those expensive tickets anyway we just recently got new nice computers installed in the library on campus  the university of texas at arlington s wifi are pretty fast with usually no troubles at all  usually  students bring their own laptops which is more convenient for them  but those who don t sometimes can find a hard time looking for a computer to use greek life plays a part more for fraternities and sororities  they throw a lot of parties but it does not play a big part on campus unless you re a member of a fraternity or sorority the university of arlington of texas are always prepared for any situation if a student feels unsafe  we have poles scattered around campus we can go to and press a button to alert the uta polices where we are at according to which pole we alert them on so that they can be aware there is something going on  i see uta police cars every day when i go to campus which helps me feel secure if anything happens to me  at night  if students are studying late  we are able to call security to escort us out and walk with us to our destination if we feel scared or unsafe  if there are any security reports  students always receive e mails instantly about what situation happened and the details about it so that we will be aware of our surroundings and the e mail also provides helpful tips the biology schedule that uta provides for me is somewhat helpful  i am not sure what i want to be yet besides the fact of being in a medical field profession  so  currently  i am following this outline of my college career to choose the classes that i m currently enrolled in  the workload is bearable  the more time you spend studying  the better your performance will be on exams  classes are fairly interesting and helpful  i enjoy going to class at uta varsity sports at university of arlington texas are not huge compared to other college campuses but plays a big part for our school  we don t have a football team  but our basketball team is pretty good  we have great coaches to help our varsity teams become where they are today  intra murals sports play a huge part on our campus since it is open to anyone who are interested in joining  our teams are very diverse as well there are not many scholarships available  and the ones that do have a lot of requirements there are not many different food places available  there aren t many people walking around we have different heritage months   so each month a different culture is celebrated not many option when it come to picking professors   not much help with financial aid if its not done on time everything is pretty laid back  i only wish everyone wasn t so up tight about tobacco use there is really a lot of stuff to do in the actual city of arlington  places to eat  things to see  but the city is a little too overcrowded for my liking  if you re in to the hustle and bustle of a big city  this is the place for you there are so many options for majors  the professor s genuinely care about their teaching subjects  the advisers are so helpful  and depending on which classes you take together and how many hours the work load is as manageable as any other i think this school has a unique and very advanced nursing program and scientific research at the moment there s   different types of dorms and they are your average prices among universities  it is highly convenient to live in dorms because they are right on campus and they also enable more social interactions between students there s a great number of computers available and they are in almost every building  never had an issue with any of them i m a psych major  and my professors are top of the line as a nursing major  i am completely satisfied with my decision  no matter what your major is  you meet new people of different types the best place to eat on campus is at the university center  they have pizza hut  panda express  chick fil a  subway  and even japanese and chinese food drugs aren t that big at uta  it really depends on who you hang out with  mostly people just smoke  that s really it my school helped me to stay focused and i received an a in one of the most dificult classes this semester not much different about our school then others  it is smaller than schools that my friends go to so the professors learn who you are  as for the building many of them are new buildings student life on campus is fantastic  every day i walk to class i walk by student organizations and events put on by them in the middle of campus uta provides tons of opportunity to advance in your field of study  the computer science program is fantastic  we just built a new building for our department of engineering and it is state of the art  the workload can get crazy at some times but there is always a place to go on campus to seek help  there is free math tutorial rooms and a lot of the clubs will also help you out with work and questions you havepeople here are very friendly  which is why it is up there with the top diverse universities the gym needs new equipment like the campus but just wish there was more people that helped us learn about events and things to do on campus i like how affordable it is and how everyone just minds their own business  it s pretty small for the student size thoughi love the school  professors are amazing  glad i choose the school        would encourage people to apply to uni  of texas the gymnasium needs a  major face lift  due to the age of the building the pool area would need to add new structure and to warm the pool because i cannot participate more than i would like to in my university  there is no support for less than part time  full time working parents the career centers are very helpful with students to obtain a career the teachers are willing to teach the students on topics in the course the cops drive around the campus to protect students they had very nice dorms for the students greek life help relieve the stress of classes a lot of students show up to support the teams there are a lot of clubs and events in the college i don t really have any thing to say on this because i don t know classes are not just classes  it s more of an open world to learn about other people in relation of the subject i feel safe stepping out both at morning and night  and it s an easy access to the school police departmentwonderful experience of your environmenti gives us the ability to socialize easilyuta plays a big part in sports due to their diversity  bringing many talents together i just needed to complete a full semester at the university to be decalred since i was a transfer student  be sure to stay on mymav  looking at your to do list because something new popped up everyday for me i enjoy it greatly because it challenges me in which it will allow me to enhance my skills for when i join the workforce  most of the instructors are very approachable and willing to help as long as you show effort  i am in the college of business and major in marketing there s always cops on duty  campus rides available school spirit in general is decent but the problem is with only basketball and baseball as the major sports to root for  there is not much variety  apart from the softball and ladies basketball  there is not much to really cheer for in the athletics sense  fan support is also a disappointment since the seats would be sold out and the turnout is lackluster for the ones that live on campus  they have the selection of a meal plan  for everyone else there are the few restaurants in the same area as the cafeteria for the students that have a meal plan  the variety available is okay but it can be improved if the times they are available would coordinate with the times regular franchises close  overall the places  meal plans and dining halls are not too shabby the restaurants around uta are not very good quality food is great for the first couple weeks then it gets old  they do try to make it interesting and have made changes after student s feedbacks so they are improving a lot but you do start to miss your mom s cooking there are emails that alert any crimes that are around campus  but i have never witnessed anything like that and i walk to the mac gym around    to    at night and feel totally safe by myselfpeople don t seem to indulge in drugs in uta  it is a tobacco free campus so even smoking ciggarettes are looked down upon and mostly everyone smokes where they are not visible or they have their own smoke area uta is very diverse  i ve met people of all backgrounds  age  religion etc  everyone i ve met is very open and friendly they re decent enough  if you were in the top     of your high school you can easily get a scholarship that is renewable each year there s a ton of stuff around the school  a little ways off is six flags  texas rangers stadium  and dallas cowboys stadium  there s lots of places to eat and tons of places to go the commuter labs and all the computers in the library are usually very crowded at any time during the day year  i can never find a computer becasue they re always being used by other students  throughout the entire semester  i probably got lucky and found a spot once or twice ut arlington life on campus is overall tranquil  sometimes  i take the long route to class to enjoy the scenery  there are many nice libraries throughout the campus for each school  the architectural library is my favorite  with the view of the garden and water fountains outside the windows  there is also a nice recreational facility called the  mac   mavericks activities center   there are two inside tracks  tread mills  a weight room  racket ball courses  swimming pools  wall climbing  and ping pong tables  there are also certain exercise courses and activities offered such as yoga  martial arts  and zumba classes there are many middle eastern and eastern asian students on campus  the guys on campus that i ve met so far are generally friendly  although the ones in fraternities are subtly arrogant  but with more confidence than anything  a quality in which i admire  most of them also seem to have strong beliefs in their religion and conviction in their academic plans  the girls also are generally friendly  but they are more likely to form cliques with other girls of their same culture  they don t completely exclude an  outsider   but they would prefer to have social gatherings with their own  i have met both guys and girls who are very intelligent and tenacious with their college careers ut arlington is steadily growing in prestige as more students enroll each year  the participation at school events isn t as active as other colleges with football teams  but the school spirit is still alive  the fact that ut arlington is one of the most diverse campuses in the u s  makes my college a perfect place for cultural learning  there are many opportunities to meet people from around the world who share their culture with others on campus in many cultural activities and events  i have enjoyed meeting people of all nationalities while growing in knowledge about the world around me living on campus is safe  the dorms are well maintained and the ra s and managers are more than willing to help uta takes student s safety seriously  at most a bike gets stolen  but no serious crimes has taken place when it come down to off campus restaurants  uta has come a long way  by opening up college park district  they have added about seven new eateries that every culture can enjoy  all within very short distances away there are a lot of great proffessors and there is such a wide variety of classes you can take it does not snow a lot here  so the classes do not get cancelled much  it does get extremely cold and sometimes a little rainy  so that effects the campus experience i came to uta as a back up plan  and after spending over a year  i ve come to my senses about uta  living in arlington my whole life uta did not seem like a huge college compared to some of the more prestigious school  but i ve come to learn its a huge school for engineering  nursing  business and science degrees arlington in itself is striving to promote a more  college town  atmosphere with the addition of new downtown restaurants and bars which really bring the majority of the business from uta students not having football team at uta puts a big burden on the campus involvement joining the greek life community on campus has dramatically changed over the years        years ago greek life was a huge part of the uta students      of the entire student body was involved in the greek community  times have changed  and its not as huge as it once way  parties are still there  and the social aspect view of greek is not as recognized as much anymore there are so many restaurants and bars around campus   honestly  entertainment and things to do in the dfw area is one of the best things about uta  hooligan s just moved into a new location  and it s a classy  elegant looking  english pub style bar  freebird s just opened  as well as smiling moose deli  which is right under vandergriff  a dorm  in the college park center  bentley s is like a million years old  but it s the cutest pub ever   the regulars will literally sit and play cards for hours  people even study there  also we just got digg s tacos which is right on campus  it s delicious  sometimes the internet connection in my dorm sucks  but the computers in buildings and at the library are pretty nice    we don t have a football team  and let s be honest  that sucks a lot  however  basketball is huge  and our movin  mavs team  wheelchair basketball  is fun to watch  homecoming has become a huge event with a parade  this dance party thing  they close off an entire street   people paint their cars and faces  it s really fun the  weather should have no effect on you grade  it could calm you down and help you learn better with the soothing noise  texas has pretty normal weather nothing out of the ordinary at least while the semster is going on it shouldnt have to much of an effect on your grade  really what determines your grade is the determination to get the grade by studying and focusing on the material you have to get there early to have any semblance of a good spot  like      am  if you are trying to park at noon forget about trying to get a good spot  getting a spot at all is the hardest part  then the pricing on the parking sticker is insane  the parking tickets are a bit strict but not extremely costly i gave uta a b  because i start in the spring and have yet to attend classes  from visiting the campus i have only been able to base my grade off of looks  it does look beautiful and i ve only ever heard good things about the education  i look forward to spring      i think the cost is reasonable  haven t received a ticket or fine yet so can t inform you much on that  you can park and leave your car in the same place due to the ease of walking from class to class unlike other schools i have attended  parking is fairly available i say use the garage if you have the extra money to do so nice dress  nice hair and eyes  usually study in the day time and party hard at night  most are very faithful once they find a relationship  it s a nice range of types of girls such as preppy to southern belles there is only two major sports that are very advertised throught  those are basketball and vollleyball  there are a lot of fans that support  the athletes themselves try to get peole involoved and go to the games i like that there is a section where most of the students classes are  so it isn t hard to find people for study groups  ther are also various places where people can go and study for free  the library is very eay to get to  and so people can use it and go to  it doesnt get crowed to get to class as much  there are event always going on for students to go to uta is a very generous school  it gives out a large amount of financial aid money every semester  i almost have a full ride thanks to financial aid  my advice for getting the financial aid is  fill out fafsa  apply for scholarships  do well in school  and take the sat since the school is in the center of arlington  there are restaurants literally everywhere  some are expensive while others are not  there are restaurants for every type of food too  and it is all within five to ten miles of the school the people at uta are some of the nicest people you could get to know  while the school does have a white majority  it has dozens of ethnicities in its family of about        students  it is one of the top choices for transfer students as well  the social aspect of the school is great because there are always people around campus to talk to  get to know  and join events with gettig into the school was a breeze  the nursing program is hard to get in  very competative  grades are very important  i did not get in the first time  i did the second time   you get extra consideration if you complete your sciences at uta  the program is challenging  the testing is totally different from wht you are use to  but they have a success center that is very helpful  these are nurse educators who want to see you succeed i like the campus  the buildings are easy to navigate and there is a lot of open space in front of the library to relax between classes the drug scene at uta is not visible to me  people are not openly expressing their participation in drugs if they use any six flags is right at the corner as well as the mall  the mac is the recreation place for most students and its a great place to hang out  safety is great and there are people monitoring safety  and there are many events to attend like the lighting at uta eating at the dining hall is a great option becausernit is all you can eat type of buffet with different types of foods  there is even a line for vegetarians  and it is much cheaper to eat at a dining hall when one is hungry there are many great convient food places around school  especially since my school is right off the main street of arlington facilities are good overall  no complaints about anything  there are many great spots to study and students respect those areas by not being too loud and obnoxious  there are so many great student acticity programs to join and they have great events so far  everything is great and convient  there are many food places that just opened up on campus  wihch is very good   the campus is not too big  everything is within    minutes of walking distance and it s not a hastle to get there  once you adjust to where each building is  it s pretty much automatic student parking lots need permitrngarage parking hrmavericks activity center at ut arlingtonrncowboys stadiumrnzoos and museumsrnvaried parks mall for shoppingthey just put in the college park center which has a bunch of cool places to eat to add to the dining halls and other restaurants on campusarlington is a really fun city but if you re not    your options are just house frat partes  which are fun   basically free  fort worth   dallas are just around the corner and a lot of fun too its not all that great   we need more nightlife places closer to campusschool spirit    campus life in dorms and apartmentsthe professors i had this semester were great  they were very helpful and as a freshman  they made me feel welcome  the registration process is easy once you figure out how to go through it  but the classes go quick so look ahead in the catalogue to set up what you want to register for so at        you can just click a button and be enrolled  the workload for me wasn t so bad this year but i only took four classes  i recommend studying farther in advance for tests  especially for chemistry  popular study areas on campus are definitely the third and fifth floors of the library  they re specifically for studying  another place plenty of students go in the lobby in the university center with all of the comfortable couches this semester at uta has been great  my classes weren t a heavy load at all for me  the nursing program is very specific  there is very little wiggle room if you are wanting to graduate in four years but it is very thorough  my instructors for this semester were amazing  my chemistry teacher explained everything so it was easy to understand  if you didn t understand the first time around  he was more than willing to explain it a second or third time if need be  overall  these professors know what they re talking about and make your life as a student easy you ve got your basic fast food chains  ie mcdonald s  right off campus  but if you go a few blocks over into downtown arlington you find a few jewels such as j gilligan s bar   grill and fuzzy taco s most of the buildings were built in the    s i believe so they look like it but aren t shabby or anything  the new erb building is very modern and pretty sweet other then a few areas under construction  the overall feel of the campus is very cozy  almost rustic campus seems pretty safe  there is a clinic located in the campus  university also has a police team located on campus i received both scholarship and financial aid at ut arlington and it was a pretty easy process although they are adding new parking garage to campus  currently parking is still a little uneasy between two major cities dallas fort worth  there are a lot of places within a    minutes drive  while you can enjoy cultural district in fort worth  you could also find finest restaurants and other fun places in dallas a lot of festivities at the university  but they could have more variety in their festivities  it s all oriented to sports and parties  call me old fashion but having a nice outing for the arts  where people can share interests about it  things of that nature  or just something simple  rather than having a loud party the professors and academic advisors all seem knowledgable and have helped me figure out what i needed there are all types of students that attend  all nationalities  every style imaginable shuttle bus will pick and drop you off anywhere you need to be on campus   very convenientthe facilities are very clean and student friendly  students are nice and there are alot of activities that a student can get into very busy  the major problem is the parking situation at campus   they have more students then available parking places   charge      for a pass that only lasts a year or less depending when you get it and you cant find an available parking spot close to where you have class living in a metroplex  there are pleanty of eating opportunities available at a low cost and high value you will need to apply early for financial aid  but after the initial walk around  it is an easy process greek life makes school life more enjoyable and interesting   they have fun events and make the atmosphere light i am very happy with my major in nursing  in just over a year i will graduate and hope to be working in a hospital in the emergency room and to one day work as a helicopter flight nurse the computers on campus at the library can be troublesome at times but over all they have a pretty easy system for useage and for printing out documents and other materials for class  the on campus internet is free to students and accessible in most places  aside from issues of speed the system is pretty good i m not familiar with all the other choices at this school considering i transferred into my major and haven t had to attend other buildings and curriculum but i would say that the school is above average in all the categories as far as major choices go  the workload in the nursing major is very heavy i live off campus in one of the better apartment complexes with basic cable  internet  and washer dryer included  i would say the experience here is really good but i don t think it would be the same if i had choosen to live at a different complex nursing is a very hard major  even having another degree i didn t have to work as hard as i do now for this degree  the workload and time needed to complete all the requirements for school is enormous  the uta facilities are very nice and mostly up to date  the smart hospital is a very handy and cool innovation for the students to take advantage of  overall i would say it is a great program to be in and i am glad to be at uta not a lot of night life or sports and the area can be seedy at night but the campus and the education it provides are above average with a great staff at uta  there are a variety of different ethnicity throughout the campus  everyone seems to get along which creates a welcoming vibe in this university it isn t really a big deal if you join a frat or a sorority  no one makes a big deal out of whether or not you are in one  however if you want to join one  the process is relatively easy here at uta it was easy  all i had to do was apply for the school  then i declared my major as mechanical engineering and enrolled in the classes the engineering department seems very organized with many experienced instructors teaching the courses the new mav center is awesome   campus buildings are well maintained   lots of activities going on complete all the forms and submitted the required information earlythe dining hall has a lot of choices and the food is good dallas cowboys stadium and texas rangers ballpark are both in arlington  the arena where the dallas mavericks play is in dallas  there are clubs  lounges and bars all over dfw  there are also tons of cultural activities and restaurants  there isn t a specific attitude towards students because a lot of locals are students too there are apartments all over arlington  some are    minutes away from campus  others are   minutes away  pricing can very depending on many factors such as gated communities  proximity to attractions  area of city and even floor level a very diverse campus with many races and types of students  i ve met fellow introverts and people who pull me aside and talk to me while i m walking around  students in class range from jokesters to intellectuals  people in the university center play cards and games on their computers up stairs  others skate and bike around on campus  there are middle aged students who have decided to go back to school  as well as recent grads  most students are social and friendly  and pda is never too much with couples  no one is indecent or obnoxious in their clothing or looks  and there is a warm air about campus most of the time uta has a very bustling campus  there are constantly musical  athletic  club  and other group activities to keep most students busy  everyone is generally polite  holds doors open for you or will make small talk  and otherwise keeps to themselves  there are many options for food and many convenient stores around since uta is essentially in the heart of arlington the student body here is very diverse  with students attending from all over the world  there is someone for everyone i am in the social work program and i love it  the department is so friendly and helpful  and they encourage you to succeed i know many students that have lived on campus  and they have only wonderful things to say about uta  they love the social activities  accessible dorms  and beautiful environment that uta offers the athletics here at uta is great  the school is very proud of their athletes and the students are very passionate about their school spirit it feels great to see activities and events throughout the semester that are related to so many different majors on campus   work load can pile up if you allow it   time management is key   most buildings are a stone s throw away the atmosphere around uta is positive and eventful throughout the year   thanks to the pro baseball and football teams close by and the summer concert series that takes place just north of campus  theres something going on often the rules and policies in place help maintain a safe and secure environment for all on campus on any day  day or night the only team that gets attention is the mens basketball team  we dont have football  and our women athletics sucks we have a wide variety of majors to choose from and pretty much is taught be professors who specialize in each section  its pretty neat we have something that will appeal to everybody  dorms and apartments both are nice and comfortable to live in the first two years you re on campus everything is new to you  so you feel as if greek life is the greatest  but when you realize they throw the same party at the same time every year it gets old  its not a big deal if you re in a frat or sorority but they do amke it seem fun the financial aid office is helpful  but they don t give you the best and detailed information on how to get the most money for school  its better to make an appointment wit senior advisors for the best help i think uta is one of the most diverse campuses out there  we have people from literally everywhere around the world  all of these different cultures coming together  there are tons of groups and clubs that you can join  you will definitely find somewhere to fit into there is so much to do in the dfw area  we have the cowboys and rangers stadiums  theres also six flags   hurricane harbor  dallas is about    minutes away and is full of big malls  awesome restaurants  and fun night clubs  fort worth is on the other side and has the stockyards and a lot of other interesting things to look at  never a dull moment i have a car so i have no trouble getting around  i am aware that uta has buses that go around all the time  they have set routes that will take you to different places  definitely helpful if you stay on campus and don t have your own car i very much enjoy sporting events at uta  they are very fun and everyone has a ton of school spirit  its a lot of fun to dress in all school colors and cheer on the mavs  the only thing i wish we had is a football team  that would definitely make uta that much more exciting arlington is so urban and helps you connect to the surroundings  so many restaurants  shops  rescources night life  living  recreations  we have six flags and the cowboy stadium  always something fantastic to do in arlington  you will never be bored i am happy to be in the nursing major  it can tend to be rather challenging  if i could do it all again  especially my freshman year i would have looked more in depth at the professors i chose  some of them really make the course difficult when it really doesn t have to be  nursing is always in high demand  so finding a job wont be too challenging  but i am ready for what my life will bring the acceptance was relatively easy  the most difficult thing was finding a seat for a biology class  those classes fill quickly my dream was to have a phd and become something but being realistic i decided to fetch a career that wouldnt be too much of a gamble  instead of studying for   years i decided to shoot for a b s  in nursing  im not terribly scared of finding a job because nurses are always on demand  yes  i would do it all over again uta strives to accept students of all races an nationalities and for this it is a very diverse campus campus strictness is pretty straight forward at this university  the rules are set out in the code of conduct and most all of it is common sense greek life is expensive with monthly dues and mandatory events to attend  if you are looking for instant friendship and countless social events in college and money is not an issue than greek life is something to consider weather here is pretty average  however there have been some record breaking winters for texas where it has snowed and iced over   most classes are cancelled when weather is adverse so i have no complaints there  summers are hot and the heat goes well into the fall semester  but again it is texas so the heat should be expected living on campus at the university of texas arlington has improved over the last few years with new expansions to the campus  there are many options ranging from dorms to apartments and lofts  parking can be difficult around the university but living on campus provides a parking lot exclusive to that living space  i would recommend the newer apartments and dorms on campus as they are more spacious and convenient in location  living on campus makes nice amenities such as the gym and eating facilities within an easy walking distance well  considering i am the oldest in my family  so going to college for the first time is hard for me  the reason is because i dont know what to expect  and so far uta has helped me understand that it is okay to have a lower grade than high school  college is actually using all the lectures and exercise and put it into the real world  for me this grade is okay  but i am working really hard to maintain a a or higher because i know that getting into the nursing program is highly competative  know i know what i need to do for the spring semester  there is alot of tutoring oppurtunities  but i dont live on campus  so is hard for me to go to those seesions  overall uta has a lot to offer to the students the financial aid is paid directly to the school  after the payment is processed  the student will be contacted for disbursement method of financial aid less costs of fees due to school growing big  located near the texas rangers and dallas cowboy stadiums  with lots of new  restaurants in the downtown area  and lots of little unique places too pretty fairly popular greek lives going on  they seem to be ok with each other  however as with most greek groups they have their own thing and own agendas and their own parties and things going on it was a smooth process for the most part  there were some additional forms that needed to be filled out and extra papers submitted but other than that it had been a blessingi have not had any negative problems with the police  they are always very helpful and careful to make all aware of any dangers  the are strict in ways that any police officer should be and its for our safety and success computers are everywhere and are usually free  except for at mid day hours and lunch  the printing stations are filled during that time because that is when everybody is on campus and everyone wants to get their work donethey are really hard on attendance  at least on the past      fall semester  they started to be really strict classes don t get cancel unless there is major weather alert   and we are always notified uta is extremely diverse  there are many different races that attend the school and there is a good mixture of people that hang together and mingle  the school is accepting of all cultures and there are organizations to fit just about any the weather is always really nice  my semester is almost up and i have not had to walk in the rain once  and everything is fairly close that even if the weather was bad it would not really matter financial aid plays a major role in my tuition  but for it to all work out smoothly  i have to contact the office constantly  one needs to make sure the office gets all the paper work and on time  early is always better  also  contact them again a month before semester begins to make sure they are not missing anything from you there are many attractions in the ut arlington area  six flags  hurricane harbor  the rangers stadium  and the cowboys stadium are really close by along with other attractions  the mall is at most    minutes away but there are many stores close by  there are many areas around campus that offer discounts for students as well the workload given at uta is fair and it really helps students understand the subjects for the most part  also  most if not all professors either show that they really care for their students or at least care about what they teach the women and men at ut arlington are very chilled back no one tries to look like there better or more expensive than anyone  it is a friendly and chilled environment everyone is friends with everyone at ut arlington all they have is one shuttle that comes very often  everything at this school is in complete walking distance  from the dorms apartments all the eating spots you can imagine  for me and my friends it is very convenient dfw has a large immigrant population  and uta seems to be one of the most accommodating schools   it has good programs that are affordable to most income brackets   ive never seen anyone ridiculed or discriminated againstthere are hotties and ugos everywhere   uta is a good cross section of the dfw area as a whole   there are many different social and academic groups around  and there is always someone in the quad selling burgers to fund raise   it is easy to find something that you can put your heart intothere are plenty of computers available around campus  the only time i recommend a personal computer is during finals week  it s can be a bit hectic at times  printing is very cheap and actually free in some of the student housing  i would not waste money on a printer but a laptop or personal computer would be a nice investment the weather is great  it may be hot during the summer but the fall and winter months are amazing  perfect weather in the fall and not too cold in the winter  it s just right my financial aid was taken care of and my left over dues were cut in half to make payments easier  i simply suggest that you begin early when it comes to scholarships and financial aid there are so many places to go and so many things to do in arlington and around arlington that it is impossible to not have a good time the campus is very convientiely placed in the town so nothing is too far away  the bus  shuttle service comes even on weekends so it is very accomodating the places around campus are good  dining places on campus are good  and there s a cafeteria  that most people tend to not eat at from what i know    there s a lot of choices around and on campus  some of the on campus usually close at   though i received a decent amount of financial aid  but it wasn t as easy as i thought it would be  a couple of my forms got lost in the shuffle  so i had to stay on top of things  i suggest making regular in person appointments with your financial aid officer to make sure things are going smoothlyi do not own a vehicle  but the parking is not very bad here  my friend has always been able to park around his dorm whenever i ve driven with him  and other friends have not complained about the parking either there is a small amount of drug usage at arlington  but for the most part i don t hear much about it  it s regulated and enforced very well  and i have never felt pressured to do drugs or drink  smoking is almost non existent this grade is somewhat influenced by my gender  but there have been pretty adequate measures to ensure that students are safe  there are police services ready to respond on campus  and the surrounding areas have posed little to no danger to anyone that i ve spoken to there are a lot of different places close by  and even more if you re willing to make just a short drive   uta is in between the arlington highlands and lincoln square shopping centers  which both have a lot of great casual dining choices  and there are plenty of other locations as well  both chain and mom and pop sort of places rnrnmost places right by campus offer a student discount  which is not always very big  but still can be helpful there are a lot of student apartments and lower rent houses just off campus  and plenty of non student apartments a little further away  as well you ll want to be sure you get to campus a reasonable amount of time before your class to be absolutely sure you get a spot with enough time to make it  but there really are a decent number of parking lots available  and shuttle service if you end up parking in a lot that s not the best walking distance from your class   there is the new parking garage as well  although a garage permit does cost extra rnrnmy only real gripe about parking is the cost of the permits being greek at the school is not as important as it might be at other universities  but it is there   most people at this school are just trying to further their careers with a degree or even just finish a degree the parking lots near the engineering and business buildings fill up very quickly  however  if you drive over near the fine arts building  you can find parking   at worst  you may have to wait    minutes for someone to leave   also  a parking permit is very affordable   there is also a parking garage off of uta boulevard  but it is pretty far from the center of campus if you don t take classes during the summer  the weather here in the dfw area is not too bad   in august and half of september  it s pretty hot  but once you make into october  the weather stays pretty temperate until mid december   we do get some pretty serious ice storms  and we don t know how to handle ice storms in texas   but other than that  winters here are very tolerable a lot of the young girls and guys are fairly attractive and pretty smart   we have a diverse crowd  especially when you head towards the side of campus with the engineering and sciences buildings   we also do have a lot of guys and girls who already have families and are commuting to finish their education there are a good number of students from all over the world especially asia  acceptance is not widely practiced because most some students prefer not to be around people who belong to different cultures from theirs the convenience with off campus housing is that you regulate your own time to come in and go out  nobody checks on you police and safety services are excellent especially as every student is required to have a police contact for emergency purposes  besides one would find police patrolling the campus from time to time looking out for the students  i have never felt unsafe on this campus student involvement in athletic facilities at the university of texas arlington is admirable  with the improvement of the mavericks activities center you can find a  stream  of students visiting the center for these activities  i have personally been there and it is worth visiting i had a wonderful time with the biking you always see faces from all other nations  especially from asiathere are many guys and girls  uta is a diverse school so you will see many international students from india to china  the girls and guys are also with different styles so artsy and some more athletic in uta i am satisfied with the courses there  there are many nursing majors but it is nice because we get to help each other and compare professors i came to uta because it has a school of nursing  courses are interesting and not too difficult you just have to try hard and study not much in the town of arlington   not much of a downtown either   the only thing you will find here is chain restaraunts i was able to get a pell grant and everything was one time there is a variety of major and minor resturant chainmainly residental living  lots of resturants and stores  traffics bad near the malls and freeways feels good most of the time   gets real hot in the summer on some daysthere s great diversity on campus  i have met people from all over the world the parking on campus is dreadful  it can sometimes be impossible to get a spot even after driving around for    minsi love uta because of its diversity  i am an international student here and i feel like i am meant to be here  all the students here are very welcoming and also there is a high probability of finding someone from your country here there are now more options with parking on campus  but its still advisable to get to school    minutes early in other to get a spot there is a no drug or alcohol use policy in the residence halls  and i can say its a very strong policy and the ras on duty are kin to follow these rules and can call the policy on anyone found violating this rule uta s sports facility  the maverick activity center  is awesome  two indoor track fields  an indoor and outdoor soccer field as well as an indoor and outdoor basketball field  also  the library holds one of the largest book vaults in texas  which helps for researching materials  the new dorm  campus edge as well as the college park center are so aesthetically pleasing and if you get into campus edge  you have access to a pool for those hot summer days  there are so many activities for everyone to do as well as fun concerts texas has a strange climate  so typically  during the spring and early summer  due to rain  tornadoes and hot weather  it becomes uncomfortable  however for weather like tornadoes  there are safety spots and when the occur  it s broadcasted around the school  as for the fall and winter  it isn t as bad and some classes  depending on the teacher  are cancelled it s a rather calm atmosphere in uta  be nice and you get treated back the same way  however  people are rather outspoken about their views  which is a plus the campus is very shaded so that even when it is very hot you still have the ability to feel cool  when it is cold  it is cold but very nice the town is amazing  we have the texas rangers stadium  dallas cowboys stadium  six flags over texas  the parks mall  cowboys dance hall  and many other fun and exciting attractions  many people believe that arlington is not safe  but in reality i fell just as safe as i would in my hometown trying to do nursing just as everyone else lol  pretty good but hard professors which is necessary in this career i can see people from around the world gather here the parking is not synchronized with the student population uta provides so man resources  but it s up to you to use them  they re improving all the time  it s one of the most diverse places i ve ever seen  you will meet so many cool and different people  the planetarium is cool  and the new college park center is awesome  they re trying to make uta less of a commuter school by putting in more shops around campus arlington is a great place to live  there is so much to do here  six flags  hurricane harbor  the ranger stadium  the cowboy s stadium  so much good food  close to i    and i     right between dallas and fort worth  unt is an hour away  dbu is    minutes away  all great things it s pretty important to have a car in this area  the school tries to make it easy for students who don t have a car by providing a little grocery store  and you can buy certain necessities at the book store  but if you want to go anywhere off campus  you will take a long time walking  parking on campus is crazy in the mornings  you have to arrive on campus early to find a close spot  if you re a commuter student   if you live on campus you re not going to have a hard time parking mostly windows  few imacs in the library and other places  can print wirelessly however  which is a plus  so i don t usually need to use the computers provided  thank god for a macbook pro we have limited international students  that are not asian   the girls that dress nice are rare because everyone usually either wears  their greek life neon or orange color shirts  which get old  or just comfortable clothes  i like seeing people dress up so i don t feel weird if i m the only one trying to dress the part  it is almost socially frowned upon to dress nice  at times  furthermore  there is plenty of talent  you just have to have game i would say the process for getting into the academic partnership was a blessing   there is a abnormal app process but it is helpful and effective for the working student   the school is exceptionally helpful in this matter so far this school has been really helpful in the admission process   the academic advisors have been patient and always available for help uta has largely been considered a commuter college  so most students are local and did not move from very far to attend the college   from my personal expierience  it has the typical feel of a metropolitan community and a  melting pot  mix of races and ethnicity   religion  however  seems to be more significant than i ve experienced elsewhere  with on campus organizations with dedicated buildings for christian groups arlington is very up and coming of recent   within minutes of campus is six flags over texas   the first of the six flags chain of amusement parks  the ballpark at arlington   host of major league baseball and home of the texas rangers  and the brand new cowboys stadium   the area surrounding the campus is undergoing many upgrades including new restaurants  apartments and condos  and bars and evening entertainment   uta is working very closely with the city to invigorate the community surrounding campus and turn arlington into a worldwide destination my degree is in biology  preferably wildlife biology   unfortunately  the school does not offer a wildlife biology program   most of the students attending are pre med and pre dental  but most of the professors are ecologists and herpetologists   the workload depends on the class  but if you want a good gpa  expect lots of study time   a benefit to take advantage of is the chemistry clinic and the secc  the science education center  the school is on its way to obtaining a tier one status  and is working to improve its departments such as chemistry to get there   i ve had great professors such as dr  rogers in chemistry and dr  frederick in biology campus provides transportation around campus and to your parked vehicle during night time hours so that students do not need to walk alone and in the dark   notices are also emailed by campus police on a regular basis  updating students on security risks  recent incidents  and precautions to be taken everyone is friendly and outgoing  finding someone of interest isnt very difficult the weather constantly changes from super hot to super coldthe scholarships get in fast and its easy to keep track ofaccounting is a very difficult major at uta  and the professors will tell you that up front   some people take math classes at other community colleges in order to avoid uta math classes   if you can make it though i m sure the difficult classes will pay off   uta also offers a lot of opportunities to accounting majors such as internships there are plenty of differing cultures at uta  as well as events that occur throughout the year that celebrates cultures   as a whole rnuta is very accepting of different cultures  sexual orientations  economic background and religion there are plenty of labs but they tend to be very crowded depending on the time of day   i tend not to try to deal with printing things at uta if possible sometimes the printers mess up   the wifi works well in pretty much the entire campus  and it s fast the campus is pretty safe  police and security are always roaming the campus  and i have never felt threatened everyone here is pretty average looking  and dress like low income students it took a very long time to receive my aid  and the people at the office were very rude the scholarships are good but you have to make sure to get in there early to be eligable  even if your a few days late  it could cost you a good amount of money everyone seems nice and dedicated to learning  there is a wide variety of people who go there which is nice so you know they aren t favoring anyone   nobody plays practical jokes on people like i have heard of at other universities  and there is simply a nice environment  beautiful campuses  wonderful teachers  and a good library no the process was fairly easy  there is an entrance exam for my accounting courses once i get into my later junior classes its looked in a very busy area to me but it have many things located around the school for students  there is many shopping centers and dining in the area  it is about    minutes from to major cities with plenty of things to do like pro sports  nightlife  concerts and beautiful downtowns there are many programs to choose from  i am undeclared but it will be business intended  my advisors are very helpful at giving me resources to help be understand better what i want to do  i am leaning towards accounting or information systems  i havent looked to much in the job search  but i will be looking into internships that my advisors have stated they would help with  when i declare a major the freshman dorms are good  kc hall and lipscomb are very okay and livable with a lot of fun activities  avoid brazzos though it s very diverse and fun place to set your future goalsthey are always hiring somewhere on campus  i always get emails about jobs the classes aren t extremely packed  so you can easily communicate with professors and peers i love how safe the uta community makes me feel i like the arlington hall dorm  that s where i ll be staying  it is clean and has a lot of space i plan on joining  so i ll see what it s actually about it s about the same as a regular college i m transferring to this school  i am currently enrolled but have not yet attended i love it  perfect class sizes and profs are engaging and funi feel good  except night classes idk the campus is dead with no one so it feels eeriei love it  great school  really cheap but classes are engaging and fun and i learn a lota very diverse university at an affordable price it s unlike other places  these students care about more than just themselvesthere s a new state of the art athletic center that proves that they carequickly created a positive opinionit is a school with teachers and advisors who care like i said before  i love it here  yes  a few things need to be worked on  but it still is an amazing campus i think we have a pretty good safety system  but honestly i think it could be upgraded a little more  i am a little afraid because i am in theatre and we usually have late night rehearsals  so we have to walk home in the dark thankfully  i got into the hall i wanted  i think they really take your preferences into consideration  i was actually sort of surprised that i was able to be in my    hall because i signed up later than everyone else  the housing process is really simple though there are many sororities and frats and the people in them are very nice  i m not in any of those  but i think greek housing options are good  they have a big house for each group it s ok but this school focuses on the engeneering department the most i came to this school because it provides a double major in criminal justice and in criminology and most schools don t people dress casual with regard of their appearancesometimes it s very hot and students don t like to participatethe places on campus are typical  uta has panda express  noodle house  pizza hut  chik fil a  subway  and starbucks  uta also has the connection cafe  which is the campus buffet style dining hall  the food here is good sometimes  but not always  uta also offers the pod which is like the on campus convenience store  so when you get tired of dining hall food  you can pick up snacks and microwave dinners here arlington is a growing city which offers six flags over texas  the rangers ballpark  hurricane harbor  and now dallas cowboys stadium  arlington also has the parks mall and arlington highlands shopping center  fort worth is about    minutes away and dallas is about    minutes  arlington has a very good location in the fact that it s only a short drive to other major cities texan weather is unpredictable but most students here are texan bred  so they are well prepared  somewhat extreme heat occurs in the warmer months  but otherwise  it doesn t rain much and not a lot of outside factors  greatly affect getting to class uta is proud of its diversity and because of this  its student body is tolerant as a whole and many its arguable that white people are a minority here  acceptance of race  sexual orientation  age  ethnic background  and international status is very prominent on campus it s within    minutes of six flags  ranger stadium  cowboy stadium  and maybe a little over half an hour from dallas nightlife most are new and there are few technological difficulties associated with them  because most people carry their own  there s always a computer available for public use somewhere everything i have eaten here at utarlington has been delicious   i enjoy the atmosphere whenever i go to the dining hall  the food her overall is satisfying to me i don t really care much about the greek life on my campuspretty good  but not alot of places to eat at and things to doits really hard in this program and you will need to remember everythingthe computer labs are usually full  and the scanerit s relatively easy to apply and receive financial aid but it would be nice for uta to expand its scholarships parking is a particular issue at uta   the parking spaces nearest to campus buildings are always full  especially in the morning uta has a shuttle bus system that runs on a consistent basis but it could add a few more stops on the route i havent had an internship yet  but i plan to find one  i feel that it is very important to get experience and to be able to have that going into the field  i am worried about finding one  however  i know that if i join the right student orgs it should be fairly easy to find one  campus offers a lot of resources the restaurants and cafeteria are easily accessible  but to receive some type of variety you must go off campus to surrounding areas as an intern working with the uta sports and recreation  i worked with providing programs and activities for disabled children looking to play and compete in sports i received a valid amount of financial aid i deserved based on my income and enrolled courses  i would suggest that you assure to complete your fafsa in a reasonable amount of time before classes begin university of texas arlington is a great and thriving school    i have enjoyed my experiences with the faculty  ta s  and  other students has been available for my every need   i have attempted to be studious at university of texas arlington  though my options remain open to other opportunities and schools arlington is a pretty large city with a lot going on  the texas rangers baseball field and the dallas cowboys stadium are very close to campus and offer the fun sports vibe that campus sometimes lacks  we don t have a football team   the parks mall is only about ten minutes away as well as six flags and hurricane harbor  if you re into the nightlife scene  downtown dallas and fort worth are only a short distance away  if you want to stay in town  there are a lot of bars and restaurants that cater to college students and have good specials  the new college park center located on campus is host to many events all year  last semester we had drake come and we had the dallas cowboys cheerleaders do a routine during our basketball game  if you can t find something fun to do on or close to campus  then you re probably not looking public relations and advertising fall under the communications department  we have fairly good professors  however there are also some i d advise that you steer clear of  check ratemyprofessor com when you re signing up for classes and make sure you re making a good choice  there are a few tenured teachers that give students a hard time and are the only ones that teach certain required courses  the major is very interesting and there are a lot of passionate teachers willing to help you out and give you opportunities to find internships and work one on one with you  if you plan on getting a masters degree  be aware that the only one offered in the college of communications is a general masters on communications that covers all subjects and is mainly useful for those who wish to teach the subjects  if you want to be more on the graphic side of advertising  i d also suggest just looking into graphic design since we don t get the opportunity to take many of these classes as an ad major uta offers a lot of different majors  and there are several that we re known for  from what i ve heard  our nursing program and our engineering as well as other science programs are really competitive and well known  i  am an advertising and public relations double major  so i m not too familiar with them  i ve only had a small handful of professors i actually disliked  but in general they re all pretty good  if you re in the same field as me  just be aware that our advertising program only lightly touches on the graphic design portion of advertising  if that s more of the aspect that you re interested in  you d probably be better of in the fine arts school as a graphic design major we usually have nice weather  but the temperature is unpredictable  if you walk out onto campus without checking the weather report  you may end up freezing when the day before was warm  it doesn t rain too often  but when it does its important to have rain boots and an umbrella  classes are very rarely cancelled due to weather  so in general uta should score pretty high  campus also has a lot of really pretty outdoor areas  so if you enjoy studying or hanging out outside  this is a good place to do it  there s often events going on outside around campus  so its a fun place to be around lunchtime fantastic professors in the education department  the education i received has prepared me for the professional world  class schedule can be arranged to accommodate a full time work schedule i was a commuter student the entire time i attended and never had the need to use any public transpiration on campus  the university has added ample parking to relieve some frustration that all colleges have an issue with because of the crime bulletins emailed frequently i do not feel completely safe on campus  however  i never experienced or witnessed any of the various crimes that have happened on campus while i attended the campus is very diverse in race and sexual orientation  as a big school  you can be almost sure you ll have someone to connect with or find interesting  all coming from different backgrounds  students handle things different ways  like and dislike certain things about people they meet  and have hobbies that some people have never even heard of  you definitely learn a lot from those around you  and gain an appreciation for a diverse campus all the basics are within walking distance  like starbucks  chipotle  pizza places  etc  there is something for everyone close by  and at low prices  the mood in these places might not be ideally college student  cool  but they are familiar and taste just fine in a pinch having the privilege of attending the bsn program at ut arlington has providing me with the knowledge i need to be successful  i am very happy and satisfy with the program a lot of hot girls  and most of them single    i suggest to stay at the dorms first semester or year to meet a lot of new people there have been crimes  and even a body was found by campus   i m not sure i would walk alone at night all the time there are lots of student groups to choose from and lots of fun eventsthey have great shuttle buses but they only go around campus  just started branching out to the mallthe fashion on campus â€“ the fashion on campus is not that great  i m really into fashion and it seems like nobody really has any  whether its just wearing something cute to class or really dtessing up  the people here tend to not really care about what they are wearing  i only see someone once in a while that is wearing a super cute fashionable outfir  of course i understand we are all poor college students and don t have money or time be buying a lot of clothes good computers  they took away our free print moneythe scholarships are good  but this again depends on academics which depends on the student  even people who have the potential to get a scholarship can t  because of the poor academic teaching the academics are really not that great at uta  it all depends upon the students   the teachers might say about helping you  but will not carry it through thoroughly  the student has to chase down the professor to get work done  furthermore  the ta s that teach classes go way too fast and therefore loosing students who take time to understand  the university is just all over the place the health and safety centre is student friendly and the nurses are helpful if you have any concern  they make sure that students are fit to attend college the greek life seems average and normal with occasional events going on  but it does not seem as inviting for a student as it should   resulting in a loss of interest or not so good college atmosphere keeping it in the culture â€“ the campus has so much diversity  you can easily learn about almost every culture in the world in one place uta has great programs most of which are recognized around the country pricy but reasonable â€“ tthe prices of the off campus housing is expensive in comparison to some dorms however the rooms are bigger and give much more freedom great basketball and wheelchair basketball  ut arlington is an engineering school and doesn t have a big sports scene but we definitely pride ourselves on basketball  at least the texas rangers are right down the road at least they re trying â€“ ut arlington has a bus route for the school  the actual city of arlington has no public transit  but most people wouldn t ride the bus anyways   hence why they don t have one  parking isn t too terrible   just get there early  remote parking and shuttles are offered cheap concentration portfolio review for studio art â€“ all studio art majors have to submit a portfolio at the end of the basic coursework  usually sophomores   it is relatively easy to pass studio art â€“ uta isn t really an  art school  but i ended up really liking it after some concerns about the lack of an art scene  everyone is career minded  practical  and supportive  faculty and staff aren t harsh or overly criticizing like other art schools in texas  what i like is how the program is willing to teach beginning artists who have had no prior experience in art education  you can try as many times as you like  will never get kicked out and you can go at your own pace if you need to old  cheap  and perfect for students â€“ there are a lot of older apartment communities that are run by the housing department  not too much as far as luxury  but it s just what a college kid needs  i lived on campus for a semester and always felt safe there  stellar english dept  even for a future pastor â€“ a good amount of classes and professors for my major were stellar  after graduating  i found myself with a budding interest in biblical studies  and ancient history  some of the classes i took for compliment these interests  my goal is to go to seminary to eventually work as a missionary or pastor  i certainly enjoyed studying as an english major and would regret if i did not take several courses that i took at ut arlington  however  i wish i had studied for my field in my undergrad accessible  affordable  and scrumptious live on south cooper st  luckily  many delicious and affordable places surround the campus  indian  vietnamese  greek  italian and labanese cuisine are all walking distance and under      in addition to many great fast food chains  students are offered a plethora of eating options near and on campus ethnicly diverse but lacks originality â€“ international students were frequently in my classes where they freely expressed their opinions  i reviewed and edited papers with people of different racial backgrounds  sexual preferences  and branches of educational disciplines  quiet frankly  however  in a class specifically for english majors  though racial diversity was rather extensive  the thoughts expressed in debates were often fairly uniform and largely reflected those   st century american culture while parking in the morning is fairly decent  parking in the afternoon is a nightmare   be sure to leave at least    minutes to an hour before your class actually starts very active â€“ i am personally not a part of the greek life on campus  but i know several people involved and can see how they are a very active part of the university not bad â€“ i personally have not had to find housing off of campus  though i have had friends obtain apartments close by  the apartments are nice and safe  and always close by  the rent did not seem to be too expensive compared to other apartments and always felt safe  they were also well kept and comfortable to stay in they do a good job â€“ i personally do not feel unsafe while going to school  they have shuttles and emergency stations for those who are uncomfortable walking  and if there is an incident it is alerted to all of the students immediately to warn them  all in all  they do their best to keep this school crime free and advise us on the best way to handle situations no regrets â€“ i was very happy with my degree  and now my career  uta was a great experience with great professors  i obtained several tools and bits of knowledge that i still use today and will be with me life long  i am going back to uta but for a mba this time  so far this department has been just as helpful and knowledgeable as the engineering department very easy â€“ research deadlines and requirements online and send everything in on time  that is it basically challenging but worth the effort â€“ i felt the engineering department at uta was top notch  very nice facilities  challenging but very intelligent staff  and connections that i will have life long  work load was a little over bearing but then again i was also working full time as an intern civil engineer intern â€“ i interned full time through my civil engineering undergrad  i felt the information i obtained through this experience was invaluable  college gave me the tools and ability to learn but on the job experience is what allowed me to put it all together and really jump start my career  i would encourage everbody to get their foot in the door where ever they can  as soon as they can to get a general feel of the industry they are persuing lots of asians and middle easterns â€“ i m not sure about any other particular fields but the engineering and computer science buildings are full of middle eastern and asian nerds  people dress nicely for the most part  and by nice i mean decent and casual  not like they re about to go out it really isn t  you go to classes and back home apartment  dorms are crappy and not very popular  if there s any drug use i haven t noticed it  but it may be present a little with the freshmen good so far â€“ i m a transfer student so i m a bit behind  i mostly got all the university core requirements out the way but fell behind on my computer science courses  classes here seem good just make sure to go on ratemyprof com before choosing one and signing up early because there aren t many options available se major  not too hard to get in â€“ if you do the work that is  computer science isn t for everyone but if you re a nerd and love programming there shouldn t be any problems  i haven t met all the prerequisites yet but everything seems pretty straightfowards in terms of letting you know what you need in order to get in the program  get calculus and physics out of the way early new dorms are very nice  i ve lived only in the newest dorm  kc  i ve visited arlignton hall as well  arlington hall is fairly nice large shared area down side is number of entrances  only the center so if you lived at the end its a long walk rnkc hall  i ll butcher the name if i try  is new and very nice  the common area is large enough and the study areas are a huge help  makes you focus generally  the beds are comfortable and the rooms are appropriate size  a little bigger than most other colleges i think walking to campus â€“ walking to campus is normally laid out well  there are a large number of private apartmant complexes with a variety of amenaties and prices there are a lot of majors at this university  a lot of them find jobs right out of college and their professional programs are really involved there are a lot of very involved greek sections  lots of them put on benefits for things and people in need  also there are special events which turn out to be really fun there s many different choices for places and types of computers  there are even many different work settings available to use them the places i have tried are not the best but are certainlty not the worst  depends on your taste buds but the student discounts make it worth iti have seen a handful of guys that are attractive and a few for girls as well  everyone dressed comfortable and they are very open about their sexual preferences and everyone kinda keeps to themselves so it is hard to make friends unless you join clubs i have only been here a few months but so far there are a lot of things to do and the nearby locations are very accomdating of students and support our basketball teami am a vegan   there are not many substantial options for vegans on campus rnso  bring your own food to be safe  i got a full ride   i studied hard in high school  and received a full ride to uta by simply applying to the school rnit pays to get good grades  i have heard good things about off campus housing around uta rnthe parking appears good and convenient  and most places nearby are new and clean everywhere you go  you see signs that express the tobacco free campus  it s in every syllabus    fully enforced   don t be late    this goes for every university  college  or school    but never show up late  or you ll have no luck finding a spot  early is on time  on time is late  late is    well     you re stuck almost every place around has offered discounts  or at least has coupons  very convenient i did search for apartments nearby  but they re all out of my small budget  if i had a larger budget  i would most definitely consider staying in an off campus housing building professors in the engineering department â€“ the professors in the engineering department are friendly and willing to help you  provided that you first help yourself  they are definitely serious when it comes to the coursework and the lectures  however  after class  most of them are quite friendly modern computer labs â€“ the computers provided for student use are kept up to date and in good working order  the students also have the choice to use either macs or pcs  whichever their preference is  due to the number of students  i would recommend owning and bringing your own computer to avoid the lab rush  this also gives you the option of choosing where you study or work as each building has a wireless network friendliest staff i have ever encountered â€“ the staff and students here are as friendly as could be asked for  any question i had  and i did have some simple ones  they answered without any hint of impatience  during orientation  some of the graduate students there just walked up  introduced themselves and started talking about what our goal was and actually got to know us  i could tell that they were not playing a role  but were genuinely interested in what we had to say a car is a necessity in texas â€“ arlington does not have a public transportation system  a vehicle is a must if you plan on living in texas  and more directly  in arlington  as far as the transportation provided by the school   i believe they have a shuttle that will take students to target  wal mart  and the parks mall  of course  there is a drop off and pick up time  overall  public transportation is horrible great places if you can get there â€“ there are a lot of different types of restaurants around uta  some are chain restaurants  mcdonald s  subway  taco bell   however  there are quite a few hidden gems  my favorite by far is a spot called jamaican gates  they have great jamaican food for reasonable prices  the only down side about these hidden gems is they are not on campus  so for those students without transportation  this could be a problem because arlington does not provide public transportation the best school ever â€“ uta is an awesome university  you have to work hard  but the professors are always available and more than willing to help students  what i like most about this university is that i don t really have to leave it for anything  they offer movie night  a bowling alley  our own little mall  opening this fall   a great gym   and the grounds are beautiful  its not much of a nightlife around here  but i m not much of a party girl  so that doesn t matter much to me  i graduate in december  but i don t even want to leave  my experience here has been great hard  but worth it â€“ school of architecture has a heavy workload  however it should all pay off in the end getting better â€“ there are many orange bricked plain buildings  however there have been more additions that show creativity new college park â€“ new college park stadium at uta was a great addition to campus life pretty even ratio â€“ at university of texas at arlington the ratio of boys to girls seems pretty even choice and availability â€“ there are plenty to go around most of the time and one can use which ever type and brand they preferwhatever you re hungry for â€“ within walking distance you can find fast food  chain eateries  bistro  bars and pizzeriaseverybody wants the close in spaces and guess what  there s never enough rnthere are a lot of people driving on campus  you re not likely to find a spot and make it to class on time if you only allot    minutes rnsince it isn t free  it costs too much  parking should be free right  uta doesn t think so  but they don t think is should be expensive either  as cheap as     a year and now that you know i feel all ooey and gooey and gushy about my school  i ll spare you the tooth decay  the diversity  overall standard of excellence and faculty support for students  imagination  expansion and creativity make uta a wonderful place to be don t think about it â€“ i ve never had to seriously consider my safety at uta  i m comfortable doing what i need to do  i function at uta much like i function everywhere else  that means i stay alert to my environment  don t flash valuables or cash  the normal stuff  its an inner city campus  so the possibility of crime exists  it happens less often than one might expect on a downtown campus and when it does  it is most often crime of opportunity great greek people â€“ i have met some amazing people who are greeks and i cant wait to go greek myselfno football â€“ i love the fact that we do not have a football team  i came from a high school that everything revolved the football team  our principal spent more money on that instead on academics  it is very nice to my money is being spent on the important things that mattergreat besides the cost of printing â€“ the cost of printing does add up  especially if you print out powerpoints  rnfinding a computer is easy besides when it s midterms and finals weekssoooo many different people â€“ amas laso fsa asa ksa vsa  are just few of the orgs that are on campus that are multicultural get involved  by getting involved helps you learn about activities around campus rnwe have so many things throughout the school year such bed races  oozeball  mavswap  activity fairs  greek events  never a dull moment besides during finals week shadowing nurses â€“ i know internships for nursing are mostly shadowing nurse on a typical day or volunteering at a hospital  both are very educational so that you have an excellent chance to see things firsthand  rni do not have any concerns in finding an internship because i speak spanish and english  this is an amazing opportunity in order to help others because you can communicate with more people very educational â€“ nursing is one of the hardest majors on campus because the chances of getting into the nursing program is very difficult  i love nursing  i enjoy helping people so it s a good major for me  the classes are hard but you have to study a lot in order to get a good grade on the tests very diverse â€“ uta is a very diverse campus  a lot of my friends that i made it was their first semester in teh usa not difficult â€“ the admissions office does not make the application requirement gruesome  once you get in you just have to get all of your forms in order and your setpretty good â€“ there are always some sort of parties going on  not always the best but something very good â€“ there are a good variety of food off campus and very close to campus  some of those places have student discounts but its not the majority of them buses run daily â€“ there are buses that run on a daily schedule throughout the campus on a    minute schedule so you can get where you need to be when you need to be there plenty of places â€“ just no money if you re a college student rnhowever  the attractions in and around arlington s campus offer all kinds of fare  from fried chicken at babe s to hot and spicy cuisine  you don t have to go far to be amused  either  ranger s ballpark  texas stadium  and six flags are all in the area needs some work â€“ the lack of a football team really shows at my school  when people pass each other on campus there is not much to be excited about  we sit in class and dream about what our futures will be like outside the four walls but don t have a reason to be there other than the education   it is also in a sketchy part of town  so that aspect at least keeps us on campus   however  it is right next to some major amusement attractions  so if we weren t all broke college students  we would probably enjoy going there plenty of activity â€“ there is plenty to do around arlington  with a large mall  imax  d theater   six flags over texas  hurricane harbor  cowboys football stadium  texas rangers  you will most likely not be bored with the activities outside the university the unversity of texas at arlington is a great meeting place for all the world s cultures  your classes are at the very least going to have two or three different cultures  lifestyles  languages  if you decide to come to the school  remember to respect the life s of all individuals off campus housing is good  if you do not wait till the last minute to arrange your living situation  be responsible being a good student â€“ as long as you study  keep active in your social activities  and keep your behavior respectable  the university of texas is a great higher learning institution at uta  academics are top notch  they offer a plethora of resources such as tutoring  supplemental instruction  and group study sessions  they push academic success for everyone but especially for freshmen  they give   free tutoring hours to freshmen and offer special programs for stem classes that work on acquiring successful study habits and lab techniques school shuttles are solid choice â€“ i personally have not used the school shutttle  but i always see it around campus picking up and dropping off students from the parking lots and campus buildings  we don t have public transportation in arlington  but with the shuttle the students don t need it  you either drive  walk  or take a taxi to school the guys and girls are ok â€“ the guys and girls seem to be friendly most of the guys are gay the school is very diverse i love it the food is pretty tasty â€“ new to the campus so far enjoying the variety of foodsgood instructors and advisors   we are required to pick our program of work immediately after acceptance   this helps prevent stress during the registration process each semester because i already know what i m going to take   i can also revise it as needed if something changes advisors and profs are available for questions but it can be confusing when you never really meet with them there is a wide range of majors available and the professors really seem to know their topics   it has been frustrating for graduate school because almost the entire program has been online   it doesn t feel as supportive as my undergraduate because i don t get to meet fellow students in person the parking permit costs      this year and there isn t convenient parking   plus it doesn t always feel safe to park far away   the shuttle system is nice during the day  but it would be great to have one for evening classes that get out after dark it was easy but expensive  i received my financial aid  but due to weird family conditions it was a bit of a hassle   i also didn t receive enough to cover my tuition  so i worked to cover the difference   i still managed to finish my undergraduate degree with no student debt and i m hoping to finish my graduate degree with  no debt either the cafe is ok  the only thing i really care to eat here are the wraps because they are made to order  everything else is pretty standard cafeteria food  the plaza is good though  with subway  chick fil a  pizza hut  sushi  etc clean school â€“ the drug use is very minimal here  not many students are involved  at least openly  there are countless ways to get involved on campus due to the high number of student organizations  most students are pretty involved in at least     organizations hard  quality work â€“ from what i ve seen of the chemistry bs degree  the students must really prove that they can achieve the degree  even up to their last semester growing to tier   â€“ many new research facilities and a special events center have been constructed in the   yrs that i ve been at uta  some buildings are quite old  but one s of great importance are emphasized one for all â€“ for a university in texas  there seems to be a very wide range of ethnicity  social classes  and religions  all of these groups have their own student groups like football  come early  stay late â€“ there are really only   lots within campus  so have your walking shoes on  allow about    minutes before class to find a spot and hike  the evening isn t any better because there is a huge population of evening classes i go to school at the university of texas at arlington  so far  i have been very satisfied with the education i have received  i feel like this school is very organized and it is very easy to get help  which is always good  i am in the early childhood education program and love it so far pretty nice â€“ apartments are for the most part pretty nice  there are some apartments that are scary  but only a few  all of the nice apartments are decently priced and include all amenities  however  the nicer apartments fill up very quickly  you must be on a waiting list for several weeks before you can sign a lease nothing special â€“ classes are all pretty average  not too hard but not too easy  average professors etc  there are a lot of classes to choose from which is good texas heat â€“ the texas heat during the months of may through october makes it very difficult to walk around campus comfortably  this leads to anti social behavior by the students during these months because students seek cooler air within the residence halls or their homes math and science dept â€“ i transfered to uta because of the strong programs in math and science many ways to get help â€“ professors are very helpful and gives informative assignments  no busy work healthcare jobs â€“ uta has many options for working students in nursing program  i have been satisfied with my online instructors  it is hard to get responses from the nursing advisors  some never respond via email or by phone  other than the advisors busy schedule i love uta there is no bus line  so unless you have good friends you are stuck at school taxi s are expensive for college students bureaucracy at it s finest â€“ bureaucracy dominates the financial aid process at uta  it requires so many documents and verifications that it is hard to keep your head straight  the way that in person appointments are handled needs to be totally revamped  there is no privacy between the students being serviced and the waiting area  i have personally witnessed   students yelling at the poor girl working at the front desk just because of the hassle that is involved with the financial aid office rent is too high  the on campus apartment prices are too high for what is given in return  the off campus apartments are abundant but finding an opening is like trying to find the lost city of gold  i m just glad that there is enough parking to allow me to live in a lower rent area and just driving to campus fair and safe â€“ my interactions with the campus police have be very positive  i work on campus at nights and the police have been very good at recovering stolen phones  one of the most common crimes on my campus   i was once stopped because a stolen phone s gps says that it was in my location   mins prior and i happened to be the only person walking by  the police approached me and were very nice throughout the stop  even talking about what they did to retrieve items when people got their property stolen  even walking home at   am  i never felt unsafe due to the high police presence in the area lots of history â€“ uta s campus has existed since      and the architecture reflects it  the central library and the surrounding building have a very stately and distinctly southern look that reflects the long history that the campus has  the new housing buildings effectively blend the modern look without detracting from the historical structures that they surround  the activities center is state of the art and has tons of things to do ranging from swimming to basketball to rock climbing  all in the same building sae program â€“ our formula sae program is very well respected and has provided many students with jobs and internship opportunities that otherwise would not have been given if the sae program did not exist  i had   former classmates that are currently employed at bell helicopters because of their knowledge that they gained participating in the program  and the best part of it all  you get to work on an awesome race car that you ve helped build from scratch lots of options â€“ there are so many possibilities  in walking proximity there are a taco bell  a nizza pizza  a chipotle  a wendy s  a subway  and a kfc  arlington has so many restaurants that you can never not find food don t live on canpus â€“ i don t live on campus but i have been in the dorms and they are nicegirls are very pretty and come from all over the united states and the world  guys are easy to make friends with  everyone just kind of does their own thing not too hard â€“ as long as you do your work success will come  if you are responsible and do homework and read the material college should be a breeze  the material challenges you but it is interesting at the same time instructors are very professional and helpful  they are always flexible even though they don t have to be  professors will work with students so they can succeed and sometimes they will even take time off their own day to help someone  i am very satisfied with the academics at ut arlingtonno availability â€“ i feel like there are more cars than parking spaces  the permit costs around      and the only open spots are a    minute walk from the campus unless you get there at  am  if  we are paying so much we should get decent parking  there is also a parking garage in which you can park but it costs   dollars a day or about     a year which is ridiculous in my opinion nothing special  if you come from a big city  you will become homesick  but there is six flags over texas  cowboys stadium  and parks mall old and dirty â€“ they are very old houses around campus and they are not clean   we have to call for maintenance very often  and the rent is high not enough facilities â€“ its hard to find computers in library cause they are all taken most of the time  there are not enough computers in our lab  psychology   printers were always crowded  but now that they have cut the budget for printing and we have to pay on our own  it became less crowdedlots of restaurants â€“ not having a meal plan is not problem while attending uta  there is a wide variety of food to choose from  from american to lebanese  most main stream fast food restaurants are within less than a mile from the school  and most of them have discounts for studentsno football team â€“ coming from a school with a football team and having been in marching band for almost   years  i was surprised to learn the uta didn t have a football team  so students have to find other means of entertainment on friday nights during the fall  though  its not diffucult  it would raise school spirit  rn    on the other hand many of the other sports on campus are excellent  our basketball and baseball teams are greatups and downs â€“ i do not stay on campus  but from what i ve observed  campus housing is great as far as what they offer  most have free laundry  are furnished  their own fitness centers  cable  wifi  etc rn    but cost is def a problem  with the cheapest being around      mo  separate lease   but if you take into consideration what you get in return  its fairly reasonable i am a commuter student and very often when i arrive to school  i have to at least drive around for    minutes in order to find a parking spot  this situation has gotten worse over the past couple years as the school population keeps growing  to top that off  the permits cost upwards of       most of the available parking is quite a distance away from many of the classrooms  with that being said  one must have a strategy in finding a parking spot  rn     one would be to arrive to campus as soon as classes start around  am and wait it out  not many people have morning classes  two would be to arrive to campus just as classes are changing  but this does not guarantee being on time for class  three would be to park off campus and risk receiving a parking ticket   one that cannot be applied to your school account rn    i usually find that waiting it out is the most effective method  its always better than being late or getting a ticket from the city of arlington rn bsn program â€“ i am totally happy with the online program   i will be finished with my bsn in one and     weeks   i have truly enjoyed taking the classes online   i will apply for the master s program in a few months   my goal is become a nurse practition   i do not have any concerns with finding a job in this field   there are so many openings in the health field online courses â€“ i absolutely love the online courses   i am able to complete my bsn degree and work fulltime as a rn   the classes are usually just   weeks long  so they can be completed fast   it is intense  but very doable   the professors have been wonderful   i am looking into pursuing my master s degree with the online program  i have been very satisfied girls are social and outgoing â€“ ut arlington has a diverse group of girls  you won t have a problem finding someone that matches your personality and of course they are very attractive i haven t had any problems with financial aid  going in person is probably the best way to handle issues  email has also proven useful for me as well lots of places off campus â€“ all around ut arlington  there are a variety of places to dine from so hot in texas â€“ really hot when walking around campus needs more shaded areasit s been a process â€“ this has been confusing  i blame my parents more than the school  though in between it all â€“ the university of texas at arlington is between fort worth and dallas   there are plenty of apartments  stores  restaurants  and a couple of bars at walking distance the police don t miss a thing  whether it s parking the wrong way in a one way parking lot  or not having a parking sticker  they catch everything  i got a ticket for parking the wrong way in a one way parking lot  and it was four minutes after i remember parking how mean to not even tell me or warn me  i ve heard a lot of people getting tickets or towed cars for parking in different lots around campus freshman year was my best â€“ i was in the freshmen leaders on campus student organization  and that was the main reason why my freshmen year was so amazing and i was such an active person on campus  i was involved in almost everything i could find  i didn t want to just go to school and read and do homework everynight i wanted to also have fun and not be so bored just doing schoolwork  i loved that the student organizations are so involved in campus and around the city too  dfw metroplex has a lot of opportunities and uta student organizations definitely take advantage of that in helping students build an active resume walking is best  walking is your best option  because everything is so close together  nothing is too far from everything else  the only thing is that the campus is getting a lot bigger with housing  but once you re on campus five minutes is enough  and you re set with walking to class and back to your dorm  unless you want to grab a bike and go around campus a little bit faster  i ve seen a lot of people who long board too right across the street â€“ trinity hall is directly across the street from the architecture building  which is amazingly convenient since architecture majors are up for days working on projects and having your home be across the street makes it so easy to just walk to your room for a quick nap and then come right back to studio to keep working on your projects campus living â€“ i do not live on campus but it is a great experience  living on campus provides you with the opportunity to make new friends  get involved in campus activities  and calls for more studying time tobacco free â€“ our campus is a newly tobacco free campus  the use of cigarette smoking has cut down tremendously thanks to this new policy men s basketball â€“ mens basketball is one if not the most loved sport at uta  fans come out all the time to show their spirit and support  we even made it to the finals this past school year  university of texas at arlington     â€“ there was nothing at all to complain about i loved the atmosphere and everything university of texas at arlington     â€“ if i could do it over again i would i feel like i messed up in so many ways and all in all i just wasn t ready  i feel like s    because i wasted so much time and money  yes i would love another chance  i would love to one day become a senator because i feel that no one ever makes an effort to help make things better everyone complains but is never ready to stand for what they believe is right they just let other people make their decisions for them and i want to show to the world that you can make a difference if you really have the drive university of texas at arlington     â€“ i really had no one to tell me what to do on this and all i can really say is make sure you accept the grants  loans  and scholarships everywhere on your school site on the fasfa site  everywhere  and also make sure you sign the promissory note university of texas at arlington     â€“ they had some good stuff but they only had like   restaurants not including the meal plan hall  which was a buffet  the the nasty ass starbucks they had everywhere  if i lived on campus i know for a fact it would get boring as f    i am truly grateful at the amount of aid that i receive from uta but the process is a bit stressful  especially if your application gets chosen to get checked  i had to do so much to get a tax return transcript because now a copy of your income tax isn t accepted  i felt very overwhelmed with this change ut arlington does a great job at providing its students with computer labs  their are labs located in several buildings  at the top of my head i could tell you their are plenty of computers available at the library  university center  and the business building  uta also offers free wifi so you can use your personal computers if you want to smoking banned  recently  ut arlington banned smoking on its campus yet they do nothing to enforce this  i still see people walking around smoking  there is this section on uta s campus that never fails to have people smoking by it  if you walk by the area you see cigarette buds all on the floor and you are sure to get a wiff of smoke  there are signs posted that say no smoking but i have yet to see anyone enforce this good variety â€“ i give off campus dining an a because of its wide variety of restaurants  also  their close range to the school  you don t have to travel too far to get to your desired restaurant  i am aware of student discounts but i don t think that the restaurants nor the school does a good job at bringing this information to the students  you really have to look for that information to find it campus activities â€“ on the campus there is a club for everyone to join and the advisers are so nice to helpparking is terrible  if you want to find a spot that isn t a block or more away  you have to get to campus before  am  otherwise you ll be stuck walking rain and heat â€“ whenever it rains  it s very hard to walk to the different buildings  the water collects very easily and there are tons of puddles  also during the summer  it gets very hot  having to walk from the back parking lot in the rain or heat is awful many options â€“ there are a lot of guys on campus  there attractiveness depends on what kind of guy you like  i would say there are guys there for every type of person  and they don t look bad either the highlands â€“ there are plenty of small places to eat in arlington  there are many shopping centers with a wide variety of food  many aren t walking distance  as long as you have a ride good food will always be near the highlands is a place with many restaurants like pf changs  bj s  and red robin  the foods here are relatively cheap labs are fine â€“ the computer labs are average and serve their purpose   you can usually find an open computer and the sound level is normally manageable average at best â€“ i don t think students at uta are the typical college students  many are older  married and have kids   they are there strictly for an education and aren t interested in the typical college partying on your own  uta is a commuter college so you are pretty much on your own when it comes to off campus housing   also  the area around uta has a lot of crime and usually isn t somewhere a college student would want to live alone uta is located in an area that s pretty populated  especially high school students  its nice because its really close to stores like walmart and target  and shopping centers like the parks mall and other places  but arlington doesn t have a public transit  so you re able to only go to places the uta bus travels to  and they only run for a very limited time easy to move on campus â€“ during the day there are several shuttles that run on campus at a consistent schedule  at night there is a pick up program that drives students back to their dorms or car  both of these services are free  but if you need to get off campus you are a bit out of luck  arlington has no public transportation system  uta attempts to alleviate this by having a shuttle that has a couple drop off points pick up points around the city for a small fee  but stores are fairly close so if you need to leave campus i would suggest using a bike  calling a cab  or making friends with someone with a car although texas is known for its unreliable weather conditions it does not affect the classes timings  because of its many green area zones we even had classes during tornadoes  its a different situation when it snows but other than that weather has no say in the scheduling of our classes another experience   good or bad â€“ well i caam to uta only because of its outstanding engineering program  the engineering professors are quite friendly  and are very supportive  although at times they place a lot of burden on us but they are more than forthcoming in understanding our situations  compared to the rest of the departments  hats off to engineering departments faculty  facility and study areas engineering major is awesome â€“ i am a software engineering major and the department is worthy of praise  infact uta is known for its engineering program  the professors are top notch and they really have reliable contacts for job opportunities for students willing to input their      effort  many of the students in our department are working for companies like amazon  dell  intel etcdorms culture fading â€“ the new dorms are awesome but some of the old ones really need some renovation  the cost is quite reasonable but the truth is that not many of the students live on campus   many of the prefer to live in the apartments because its much cheaper there compared to the dorms  plus the housing process takes a lot of time the people are eh â€“ everyone looks the same  but there are some good looking people around they are pretty basic â€“ the strictness of the campus is pretty basic   if you follow the texas laws then you should be doing alright on campus   when you break the law then you are most likely breaking campus rules and you could be suspended or kicked out of the university the gym is amazing â€“ the gym is brand new and it is great   the gym has all the machines you need in order to get in shape   not only do they have machines but they offer aerobic classes too   the student center and library are both very clean and offer many things   i really enjoy each facility at uta good times â€“ the university of texas at arlington is a great university to attend   as long as you stay focused on school and not only your friends you are guaranteed to be successfull   all of the professors i have had so far have been great and very knowledgeable about the course they are teaching   if i were younger and were to choose a university to attend  i would probably choose a more popular university like the university of texas at austin   overall  the university of texas is a great place to get your degree at maintaing this gpa â€“ most greeks require a gpa minimum which keeps students on their toes ehen it comes to their grades   i ve seen several greeks do things on campus trying to raise money for chairity or student activities and organizations   greeks make going to school fun because they usually are having fun  offeing good food  and playing good music  if i were younger i would have definitely joined a serority work hard play hard â€“ i would do everything again  but differently  uta s nursing program is prestigious and many of my friends got jobs while still in the program  my career goal is to become a travel nurse and i m not that worried about finding a job as a nurse  nurses are in demand nursing major â€“ being a nursing major at uta is hard work  you not only fight to have a chance of being accepted into the program  but you need to fight to stay in  rnuta is one of the top nursing schools in texas and it has state of the art equipment  the school offers an on campus program and an online program our basketball team always does really well in the sun belt conference   i think that is what it is called   and the workout area is huge   it is literally so awesome  it is rated in the top ten of most diverse universities in the nation  the people on campus are very caring and sweet  i haven t met someone who is genuinely mean yet  so that s a plus  the theatre is so beautiful  i live everything about it  i love uta  so i think i would choose it again if it came down to it because  not only do i love everything about my major  but the people are really what make this school so awesome and spirited since my focus is strictly nursing i am not familiar with the athletics department  i also take all of my courses online which makes it difficult be involved in any sporting events uta at arlington is the best choice in north texas to continue nursing education  they offer a very flexible rn to bsn online program that is perfect for a full time working nurse  thanks to uta i will finally achieve my goal in completing a bachelor s degree in nursing  i would definitely recommend uta to any future students i havent looked into finding an internship just yet  but that is definitely on my upcoming to do list uta honestly has proven to be an amazing college  i couldnt have wished for anything better i have seen the dorms of friends and theyre all pleased im personally not in one  but they all seem friendly enough uta has a great gym and facilities to do a variety of sports uta has taught me so much my first year it really depends on your major  but the workload and rigor of the courses range from average to very difficult  in the classes i ve taken  i have been able to learn the subjects taught  but the workload was very difficult to arrange  time management is an important asset to have in this university  there are various areas where students can go to obtain resources or study time in order to further their knowledge since the university of texas at arlington is one of the top schools ranked in diversity  a lot of the students are pretty accepting of each other  there are many international students and students from different ethnicities and backgrounds attending the university  everyone has been quite tolerant and accepting so far depending on the people that you hang out with  you don t really get to be pressured into taking drugs or alcohol  there is talk about alcohol among students  but it s really private before i attended the university of texas  i grew up in a very conservative  small  texas city where the majority of people looked and acted the same  although  by coming to uta i have been exposed to an amazing array of cultures  people  and ideas  i was very timid and uneasy about this change in the beginning  but eventually  i realized that i had an amazing amount of opportunity to change my narrow views on the world  although i hold my conservative values with a strong will  i am proudly more open to other ways of life  i may not necessarily agree with the actions or beliefs of others  but i am no longer quick to judge and shame  with uta being the  th most diverse college campus in the united states of america  anyone truly has a unique opportunity to succeed here   rnrnadditional to learning new social skills  i have quickly realized i am very fortunate to attend a university that shows true passion about the department of my major  i have a surplus of tools  world renowned professors  and labs at my convenience to help me succeed in finishing my civil engineering degree  rnrnwhen i graduated from harrell a year early in       i saw coming to uta as a boring   year long sentence rather than an opportunity  i now realize that between my alpha chi omega sorority sisters  academics  and friends throughout campus are none the less a blessing i would do again in a heartbeat it looks fun  they have a lot of events to go to and the housings are all on greek rowwe have such a great support for our teams at the school  people show up every timeit makes a lot of us feel at home especially most of us being far away from homei believe that this school has a  lot of opportunities to help students transition into their careers  the fact that the staff has been so helpful thus far makes me feel like i have the support to help me advance  everyone has been encouraging  and has provided me with the information needed to ensure i have a smooth transition into this university   my advisor has already got my whole schedule together to make sure i m on the right track to completing and achieving the degree i have been seeking  with this degree i can then move on  into the career path i ve always dreamed i have just transferred to the university of texas arlington so i can t really give to much of an opinion about what i think about the school  and it s professors  i will say thus far i ve had a great experience just dealing with my advisor in my department   and whenever i ve had a question as far admission goes  and dealing with the staff in the admission and records office everyone has been nothing but helpful and nice  so that makes me excited about going to this school  and completing a degree in exercise science all of my classes were very diverse in terms of class size and style of professor  my only complaint is that i didn t like how strict a few professors were signing up for classes can be a headache  it s basically a free for all and once classes are full you re out of luck  but  the teachers here are amazing  they re very knowledgeable in their subject and i have loved the t a  s that i ve had so far  there are also different types of classes you can take such as t th  mwf  once a week classes  and there s even online classes mixed review â€“ the people on campus dress nice  they don t go out looking like they just rolled out of bed  the gym is a popular spot especial for the sorority and fraternity people  most people are friendly and the campus is very diversejust noise at night â€“ the apartments have thin walls but i still love living here no drugs â€“ i ve witnessed a teacher telling a student to not smoke on campus   and hasn t seen someone smoke since then school is awesome â€“ i would like to continue my education at university of texas at arlington because it is the one shool that has all my needs and want for my career for the future   great teachers and such a friendly place experienced professors in landscape architecture â€“ the professors within the lanscape architecture department are all very well educated and have a diverse professional background  regardless of the specialization within the field that a student chooses to go into  there is at least one professor that has experience within that field  the professors are generally helpful and knowledgable about their courses and subjects activities center â€“ sports are not a central aspect of life on uta campus  the maverick activity center  mac  is the gym on campus and is an excellent facility  it houses two indoor running tracks  climbing wall  bad mitton courts  weight and cardio centers  basketball courts  dance facilities  a commuter students lounge  and many other amenities the overall outward look of campus is dynamic  the buildings are all constructed of matching brick and steps have recently been taken to improve housing  recreation  and environmental efforts on campus  unfortunately the campus is unbalanced in their priorities  buildings such as the new engineering building have been recently renovated and are state of the art  this is because of the importance the engineering department has to the school  this priority is not evenly distributed across the campus  buildings such as the architecture building are not cleaned or repaired with equal importance to others  they are missing such simple priorities as lightbulbs in classrooms  the school needs to make more of an effort to equally distribute their funding and care across the campus regardless of the popularity of the major housed within the buildings police always present â€“ more recently uta has increased the police presence so it s pretty safe  there are a good amount of police call stations for emergencies and they will escort you to your car if you ask them to  that said  some of the further parking lots are very dark and scary at night more of a commuter school â€“ uta is not really a party school   there are frats and sororities but it s more of commuter school with an older crowd of students  there s a few bars cli to campus but they are older and not always busy   might as well skip the arlington scene and go to dallas or fort worth music is the way to go  i absolutely love being a music major at uta  my music classes are the best part of my days at school and i really enjoying participating in band an orchestra theft and shady places â€“ i had never witnessed theft before coming to uta  but i have seen three bike s stolen on various occasions throughout the school year  a close friend of mine even got grabbed and pulled into the forest near the mac before christmas break  i don t feel safe walking alone especially at night teachers have become my close mentors â€“ never in my career as a student have i felt so inspired and closely supported by my college professors  they have even gone so far as to give me their personal cell phone numbers and invite me to thanksgiving dinner at their house when i had no where to go  i love going to class because the professors care so much about each and every student as well as the coursework they present it s above average â€“ although i don t like everything about the school it is still pretty good  not all teachers are that good and barely anyone likes the math department  still good to go to though i m white  and i d say that there is just as many people of other ethnicities as there are white  although religion isn t as expressed as much as other things  there is still more than just christianity around campus  the male to female ratio is about equal more than i expected â€“ they have more things available to me than i expected  i love the library tons of resources many options â€“ i have decided to live off campus because i am starting college a little later than most  but i did appreciate all the options for on campus living  i had no idea they had so many complexes on campus great variety â€“ the meal plans are decently priced for what you get  there is also a great variety of regular food and specialty food i dont hangout with the party scene but i do hear more about the drinking than anything else extremely diverse â€“ uta has alot of international students so we have a little bit of everything good amount â€“ i received enough financial aid to help me pay for tuition  books and my living situation the shuttle runs throughout the week around campus and there are special little stops around campus where you can wait for it where it arrives at one every    minutes gym is amazing  the mac or maverick activities center is a state of the art  beautiful and newly built gym and recreation center  it has all of the weight and exercise machines you can think of  indoor rock climbing wall  indoor soccer field  indoor and outdoor basketball courts  indoor running track  indoor and outdoor volleyball courts racquetball courts  badminton courts  pin pong tables indoor and outdoor pool  locker rooms for your personal belonging and showers  special rooms for workout classes like zumba and pilates  computer area with printers aside  small market with energy drinks and snacks not noticeable â€“ i haven t seen any evidence of drug use on campus there are many restaurants to try that are in walking distance from the college  the only problem is facing traffic good internship opportunities â€“ there are plenty of internship opportunities available  they work around your schedule and give decent pay  i was an intern at a botanical research institute and i can only presume that this internship will be able to get me the connections i need in life  they provide you with enough responsibilities during your work day that keep you busy not many options â€“ arlington in general doesn t have public transportation so going long distances would be hard  but you could always call a taxi  the school has transportation that will take you from your dorm apartment to the main campus or recreational fields  school transportation doesn t run       your best bet would be to either have your own car or become friends with someone who drives if you want to be able to get around arlington dallas is very near and the nightlife there is amazing  you will never get bored in dallas  for fun around arlington  become friends with people who throw house parties  there are always parties it just depends on who you know  clubs aren t plentiful in arlington the parking area gets really fully in the mornings  you would have to come to class maybe       mins before your class starts  however  there has been a newly added parking garage and with the construction of new apartments for the next school year i am sure that there will be an increase in parking availability communications for a reason â€“ as a communications major at ut arlington  they know that we choose communications because we are socially talented  you re only required to take   college level math and science classes  which is amazing  i m terrible at those   subjects so it really helps me out  uta is in the middle of the  th largest television and radio markets so it s a great location to gain experience need more â€“ the parking on campus is horrible   you really need to get to campus at least    minutes before your class starts to find a spot  and once you do  you need to hurry up  because chances are  you are already late for class getting better â€“ nightlife   uta is getting better for those that can enjoy it   they have recently spruced up the place and added an on campus bar and small shopping center   things are looking up for sure   there are tons of entertainment centers around the campus  six flags  the rangers and the cowboys stadium very smooth â€“ my financial aid experience was very smooth  all i had to do was to fill in my fafsa and it only took about three days until i got my response and information absolutely divers  there are so many races at uta  i ve seen many arabs  asians  whites  african americans  persians  and many other races  it s just absolutely divers so many things to pick from â€“ at uta  there s always something to do  whether it s on campus like university related activities or off campus  there s always a basketball game  many places to shop at  gyms  six flags  good restaurants  and it s close to home so i can always visit the engineering research facility is great  the facilities at uta are awesome with many labs and resources  the building is designed to help the environment since it incorporates energy saving features like green roofs and ways to capture water and store it for landscape use  it s a really good environment to learn and explore alcohol doesn t help students learn â€“ alcohol is accessible by students   they don t need it   they need to study the parking is okay if you get there a reasonable amount of time before class  if you don t you might have trouble finding somewhere to park around town â€“ if you go out and explore the nightlife you ll have fun online rn to bsn  nursing  â€“ except for nursing research and vulnerable populations most of the information in this program was a repeat of my adn program  though i have a high gpa  i will say it was difficult  not because the information was challenging  i have learned most of it before   but because of the shear number of little writing assignments hidden in strange pockets throughout their system  i see frequent posts of students saying they didn t see an assignment and begging for an opportunity to complete it late  the answer is always no rnrni am lucky that i learn best out of a book  other than prerecorded lectures  access to the instructor is forbidden  people can only email or post forum questions to the  academic coach   these coaches are not employees of uta  but contracted by a company called stateu com  or subcontracted from some other nameless corporation  if students ask coaches about confusing points on nursing topics  they are referred back to the text  if they ask the coach to clarify foggy requirements for an assignment  the coach refers them back to the assignment instructions  almost every email i sent to a coach was replied to with an email that might have been cut and pasted from another source  it s like chatting with ibm customer support online rn to bsn  nursing  â€“ really  the only thing you need to get into this program is apply  transfer credits and pay the tuition  however  once you are in the rn to bsn program  you are stuck in a degree mill program doing strangely difficult busy work for the following    months bad with sports â€“ this school is only good for its basketball team  everything else isnt really heard off  joining a fitness health class for non academic purposes are expensive  if uta wants us to be healthy lower the prices please alright school â€“ it has been okay coming to school here  uta is not really a known school except that it has a good nursing program  it has no football team which lowers its rank upon other universities police enforcement lack â€“ there are way too many posting on crimes that happen throughout campus  there should be more polices walking around  guys going around slapping butts even in daylight and then run off usually there s always a computer to use unless it s during lunch time where most people don t have classesdrugs aren t very big at uta  usually just drinking or smoking cigarettes  some smoke pot legs exercise is uncalled for â€“ college parking sometimes makes me regret having a car  starting with a overly expensive parking stickers  i always become very anxious of parking tickets  i once got a parking ticket for a ridiculous reason  the reason was because i parked my car in the same direction as the car that was behind mine instead of facing another car on the other side  of course i didn t make the same mistake to get a ticket  also  i always have to make sure i get to school    minutes before my first class to find a parking spot  i m sure i will get used to it as i become a sophomore tobacco free campus â€“ one thing i really like about our campus is that uta is tobacco free campus  the signs are everywhere throughout the campus and you rarely see people smoking upfront  also there are always security guards or police officers walking around to secure the campus unforeseen greek clubs  activities â€“ as any other greek organizations at universities  a lot of students are involved in greek life  so are called fraternities and sororities  as a non greek student  i heard of what they do in those societies  such as crazy parties and drinking  however i recently came across with the realization of greek students  unforeseen activities  this one frat guy in my theatre film class made an announcement with the professor s permission  he was wearing a nice suit and had some    bills pinned on his chest and i thought to myself  he is probably announcing that there will be a huge party for his birthday or something  contrary to my expectations  he shyly began to speak about the awareness for raising money for the kids  birthday who are facing financial struggle  this changed my perception of greek influence on our campus  they also come out in the university center or plaza to spice up the tedious atmosphere and entertain the students to get together  there are greek organizations such as  delta sigma theta  gamma sigma alpha  and kappa alpha order the on campus housing at uta is average at best  the current housing is very old and broken down  recently though  the campus has begun building new apartments which are in great condition  so there is improvement in the on campus housing there are plenty of food choices off campus for students  you can find student discounts almost anywhere and the location of the majority of the restaurants are just a few miles down the road here at uta we rarely have health or safety issues  although this campus is enormous in size  the campus crime police do a stand up job in dealing with various issues and keeping everyone safe sports are not that big here â€“ i hear the basketball team is pretty good  i wish we had football being that we have an unused stadium just sitting there appartments all around  no public transportation so you ll need a cargood professors  when i was in the pre nursing program  i endured professors that love the subject  but horrible at teaching  they say to study one thing  but then test over material that was not gone over heavily a commuter school â€“ a majority of students drive to school on their own accord  there is a bus system  but it is only use if you park way over on the stadium side  at night  though  they have a system to take students from place to place on campus if needed so students don t have to walk alone at night the frats and sororities are very involved with campus life  there are only a handful though that have houses of their own all financial aid that i obtained was thru my high school    now some scholarships did not have enough funds so now i dont have enough moneyjust be alert â€“ every now and then you get a crime alert about someone approaching a young lady walking by herself at night  but people  especially young women  need to be extremely cautious when walking by themselves at night perfect mix â€“ you have cowboys stadium  ballpark in arlington  six flags  and hurricane harbor all within a   mile range  there are fast food restaurants and local bars in walking distance of the campus it is really good we have a cafe and plaza plenty of optionscampus crime â€“ there has been a couple of incidents caused to a couple of studentsits good â€“ the nightlife is amazing and the city is so alive at night alcohol here is very well monitored and not abused that oftenreally diverse â€“ this campus is one of the most diverse campuses i ve ever been toi feel safe â€“ the police system here at uta is a well department  if i call them they respond at quick timesgreeks are amazing  there are a lot of greek houses on campus  greeks basically run campus which shows how committed the students are to social life within school it s okay â€“ there are a lot of things to do but after a while it loses it s excitement  although the campus just got a new gym which is amazing and fun    the dallas cowboys cheerleaders came and the rapper drake    all the facilities on campus are well taken care of it s great here â€“ if you like the city then this place is great for you  there is always something to do on and off campus  there are always great concerts and events for the students  its not too big or too small of a campus everyone s average â€“ there are all variety of girls and guys here  some are hot and some are not  it just depends on your taste  it seems like most girls and some guys i meet are in soroities or fraternities apartments are average â€“ there are both expensive and cheap apartments  but you get what you pay for  if you want a nice modern apartment  it will cost you  but if you dont mind not having all the pizazz  then it s affordable  i have noticed that most apartments are really old because of the rate at which technology is advancing  but they are building more modern apartments around the city  i think the only con of living in off campus housing is the commute and being away from all the on capmus activities places to eat â€“ there are a number of places to eat near the uta campus   you have a choice of chicken from kfc  fish from long john silvers cajun corner if you have a taste for spicey food   tacos from taco bell  starbucks is close to the campus   chili s is down the street so you do have a variety of choices the school campus shuttles are constantly running so if you miss one there will be another one soon   they are relatively fast and heated  uta is a commuter campus and there is not enough parking and tons of traffic around campuscampus centers â€“ very few of the buildings are run down  and there is a newly built parking garage   uta also recently finised a new gym for the basketball team   the mac gym at uta is also very nice looking there are numerous computer labs but printers tend to not work or make low quality prints  there is also a charge for printing and it is more effecient to just buy your own   the wireless internet is fast but sometimes has trouble connecting to computers there are a lot of     bar grills and dive bars in arlington  which is right up my ally  but since arlington isn t really a  college town  the drink prices are pretty standard as opposed to other places where they have dollar beer nights and what not  there are very few     clubs  and for good reason  its dangerous  cowboys is a death trap for underages  fights every night  drugs and sexual misconduct out the wazoo bring your pepper spray â€“ due to the terrible parking situation and the surrounding dangerous neighborhood  it has become the norm for students  myself included  to carry some form of protection  we get regular emails from the university police weekly about someone who was attacked mugged or even almost abducted not really sure how the transportation works  i usually drive therecomputer labs â€“ there are many computer labs  especially in the library  the network liability and speed is great  the librarian is very helful and you ask all the questions you want if you need helpit is very stressful because you are trying to hardest to keep up with your grades  we mostly needs a s in order to get accepted into the nursing program  the workload is normal i guess everywhere you go and whatever it it that you are trying to major in you will have alot of assignments to do  the nursing building is the best  it has great places to study the staff is very friendly and help with whatever you have questions with underage life â€“ there is to much underage drinking and partying that lead to pregnancy and other thingsthere is so much diversity whoch allows each student to explore different culture and society parking garage security â€“ i feel they should have more patrol on foot around the parking garages especially at night not a big deal â€“ the local weather is sometimes strange  you never know how the next day will feel like  but buildings at the university are very close to each other so the weather is not a big deal the best it could be â€“ i am really happy with the schools network and accessible computers as well as printers glad i m here â€“ i had considered transferring after my first semester  but after joining a fraternity  getting involved  and having great econ professors  there is no way i m leaving this place until i graduate greeks own the college experience â€“ i waited a year and got really involved at uta before deciding to go greek and there is a huge difference   greeks are way more involved and have way more school spirit than most students school spirit on the rise â€“ everyone complains about the lack of a football team   our wheelchair basketball team is one of the best in the nation and those games are ridiculously exciting   the new sports center is fantastic and students are getting more and more proud of our sports program school policies â€“ the school has some pretty strict rules when it comes to parking  many students here get parking tickets for no reason  overall i think that the safety of the students is very important so having security is a good thing there are many different people at ut arlington  which is why it is a great campus  there are people from different social classes  guys range from city boys  country guys  fraternity guys  rich guys  middle class guys  many interest for guys here at uta include joining a fraternity or a sports team  similar to the guys  girls can vary here  some girls are very classy  others are very nice and outgoing  and some can be a little rude  overall the we have a pretty great student body the university is a great place to get an education  not only does it offer many degrees including some doctoral  it also has a great faculty staff  many of the professors here have the highest degree on their field  the student body is very diverse and it creates a great atmosphere  the registration process can be a little stressful and time consuming but it the counselors are very helpful when needed  the amount of work depends on the professor but it is usually a good amount  ut arlington offers many tutoring options to help students be successful  some of the tutoring programs include math  the writing center  and private tutors  there are many places to hang out with friend or when someone needs to study  the university center has great study lounges  the library has a study hall  and there a quiet rooms around campus like the one in university hall  i came to arlington because i got into cap at ut austin  i decided to stay at ut arlington because i realized that the science school was great  it s okay â€“ i like the people and some of the classes in other departments  but the art part of this school is terrible and the advisers are just evil there isn t very much involvement of the sororities and fraternities on campus  it s a joke somewhat safe â€“ i am just the kind of person who won t be seen anywhere at night alone  i hate going places alone as it is  i do not walk on campus after dark alone and i refuse to sign up for late classes  i am so scared something is going to happen and there are always bulletins of robberies on campus and crimes around campus  everything is always lit but i still am scared more drinking than doing drugs â€“ arlington is really small  there is not too many places to visit on the weekends so most of the people drink here a lot the safety and security features is really tight and secure  i never have felt unsafe on arlington campus why i would choose it â€“ uta has the best tuition rates in north texas for a universitythe area near the campus has many options to eat  most are inexpensive and quick serviceprinting on campus â€“ the printing system was recently changed and students are now charged to print  whereas before there was a set amount already placed in each students accountbuses are an option if you want to mess with the schedules and waiting  bikes are a very good option if you have to park far away and get to class on time or if you live close to campus with a fairly active greek life  there are parties available to go to  the bar scene is good for    and up  lots of restaurants and bars and strictly bar venues with music and good deals for college studentsthe available parking on campus is based on the time the diversity on the uta campus is a  melting pot  of races  and each race also  gets along well with each other um what transportation  never heard much information about it  ive seen one or two small shuttles   there are usually computers available for use  not really much of a problem there  the computers only get crowded during certain times like the middle of the semester or the end such as for tests  i dislike that you can only print if you have money on your card  cant pay on the spot or something like that well  it goes for the same at most colleges  however  if i were to point on a specific drug alcohol usage  it d be beer and wine  it is not really bad  but when it gets in the way of studying with a study group or area  that s when things get hectic ehh  i have quite a few who attend arlington and they all say it is well  they are content  this means to me  they are not satisfied  but good enough to be content  some are quite expensive  others  well not so good  most apartment areas and landlords will absolutely raise the price for first year students i ve never really been on campus for housing  but visiting friends and family in the area  i would say from the looks of it  nice and well done  the atmosphere is mind blowing and the spacing looks excellent there are a lot of     bars around because i guess they know that    year olds like to go out too  there is cowboys arlington which has country nights as well ship hop nights so it goes out to many people and suits many different people  there are a few bars down a street away from uta that are very popular  other than that we all go to the ft  worth stockyards and hang out there or a lot of people go to bars in dallas  it also helps having fraternities right here because they go out all the time we have multiple athletic programs here at uta  something for everyone  we have a boys and girls basketball team  volleyball  softball  baseball  swimming  and more  we have a cheer squad who wins first at nationals every year and a dance team  for people who don t have a lot of time but love to dance there is a dance class that performs at the end of each semester  i was a member of the dance team my freshman year and we danced at every single game  i am now a member of the dance ensemble and perform every semester  at each game there is so much support and spirit  so many students dress up and paint themselves or scream their heads off for our team so many options here on cooper street  there are so many options available to choose from  there are a number of starbucks close by as well as two locations on campus  there are many fast food restaurants available like jack in the box  sonic  taco bell  taco bueno  and chipotle  if you dont like any of those  you can check out the dining area in the parks mall which is only   minutes down the street where they have many italian and mediterranean food restaurants  chik fil a  sonic  charley s  and a cupcake store  as well as many well known restaurants around the area such as red lobster  in n out  and ihop  if that doesn t satisfy you  there is a super target and walmart where you can go buy your own food to make  also  most of these places give student discounts if you show id  my favorite place is the steak n shake where they have great burgers for cheap biggest drug is energy drinks â€“ i don t know what the drug scene is around campus  but drinking is always number one  however  monster drinks etc    seem to be everywhere all the time not your typical college town  town came way before college and although there is plenty to do  it is spread a distance across areas of town  however  growth and new construction is helping with college life atmosphere  a positive is that you are between two great cities with lots to do ft  worth and dallas one of thousands â€“ i am a part time commuter student  i have found that science classes required for nursing major are large with little to no choice in times days of availability  there are so many pre nursing and pre med students that you would think there would be more classes available to accommodate  this translates to distance between you and the professor because there are just so many people at the office after class waiting for a turn to talk with him her the campus police or security will help students if its too late at night i have seen students getting a ride in the campus vehicle t their parking lots or bulidings if they feel unsafe at night good school â€“ uta is a good public university the professors and advisors are helpful the campus is clean and overall environment is great i love ut arlington im content â€“ im very content with the program that i am in  i feel that the instructors are very thorough in their course work presentation i can always find a parking spot right outside the building that my first class is in and all my other classes are in the surrounding buildings  i cant complain exercise science â€“ being an exercise science major at uta is pretty cool  i plan on doing physical therapy post college  and here at uta  most of our models of my science classes are state of the art and very awesome to handle  i work load is not too bad  typical college workload small but holds a big punch â€“ greek life at ut arlington is small in numbers  but that does not stop them from raising money and being known on campus  there are only a handful of sororities and twice as many  if not more  fraternities  each has their own philanthropy event that draw in people from all over and they come in numbers  greek life continues to grow and expand and will hopefully one day return to the way it was in the    s  where majority of campus was greek gotta drive to attend â€“ the nightlife within arlington suffers due to the long distances between bars  if a student does not drive it is hard to attend  most of the time bars overcharge for drinks and house parties attract more people  plus they are free  no need to bring alcohol  and usually are at a fraternity house so its walking distance for most students hard work pays off â€“ i came to ut arlington to study architecture  not knowing the work load that it involved  while the work load is overwhelming at times  and professors can be harsh  the hard work did pay off  classes outside of studio work were enjoyable because discussion of ideas was promoted not too many scholarship â€“ as being a business student  the business department of ut arlington does not have that many scholarships to give away  every year there is only few and it is really tough to get them  unless you already have a scholarship when you transfer  otherwise it is pretty much impossible to get a scholarship while studying at ut arlington  my best advice try to have a scholarship before you start your career at ut arlington there is nothing to do here â€“ arlington city is a small city  and there is nothing to do here  most people goes to either dallas or forth wort as most fun places are located there girls are friendly â€“ you will find all sorts of guys and girls at arlington city  the whole city is quite diversified when it comes to people  the girls around here are pretty friendly but most of the girls going to college tend to live in other places as arlington have not many places to go to intramural sports activities â€“ flag football team  would be considered the mot popular i live at home  therefore i am unsure of the housing conditions at uta i have not come into any problems when it comes to parking  but i also don t have a car and try to walk to most of my classes i would rate the drug and alcohol enforcement at a      new and cutting edge â€“ ut arlington campus continues to add world class and cutting edge technology with every new building it adds to campus its good living on campus  my parents were not able to afford a dorm but i did have the opportunity to stay with friends some nights and i really thought it was a safe and friendly environment  i would personally recommend its a    minute drive to school and another       minute search for a parking space  for the price of the permit being about     there needs to be more availability  also one day i drove my father s car because the school supplies i needed did not fit in my tiny car when i spoke to the officers about the fine they gave me for not having a permit on that car  they still made me pay for it although i do have a permit there is everything   you can find just about any restaurant within a   minute drive  ranging from all ethnicity and all price ranges night time lighting should be increased  on occasion i receive e mails describing a recent crime on campus which does frighten me a bit  especially when i stay at school into late hours of the night doing projects  the lighting at the school while kept dim  to i don t know maybe make it look nicer and pretty is dangerous  i do wish there were more lamps and brighter bulbs because there are so many spaces around campus that are very dark and you would not be able to tell if there is anyone hiding around this univeristy has such a diverse selection of people  every person looks different and has something different to offer there are many different places to eat  there are pretty cheap and have dollar menus i don t know â€“ i am in the dorms and plan to be in on campus apartments next yearthe greek life on our campus is almost non existant  there are no  divine nine  sorrorities on the yard  except for the sgrho s  everyone else is either suspended or non existant  and as for our frats  the alpha s are on top because of all the parties they throw  as for everyone else      they re rarely even talked about there are many options for off campus housing  the apartments that are expensive are either not worth it or the lease is for a whole year instead of just the academic year  all of the apartments have their pros and cons very safe â€“ anytime there is an incident that has happened on campus or near campus we recieve a crime bulletin  this helps make the campus feel like a safer environment the campus life is awesome  you are able to meet more  and be involved in more groups and organizations  uta is very diverse and its hard not to meet people everyday there are five dorm buildings and they are currently building another one for fall       all the dorms are great in their own way  arlington hall have the bigger rooms and great all over   kc hall is known for the study dorms  brazos  lipscomb  and trinity is known for social and more community  kc hall is the highest cost at     and brazos is the cheapest at     if you re looking for that bustling college friendly town  then you ll more than likely find arlington boring  the downtown near the school is just   a disgrace  dallas    fort worth are just a drive away if you re willing to make that though decent selection but not a simple walk away  there are actually quite a few good restaurants off campus but their not necessarily a walk away so you ll need a car to get to most of them  the best place to find a restaurant to eat out at is the arlington highlands which is about a      minute drive off campus  they have places such as pluckers  dave    busters  genghi s grill  mexican food  italian food  asian food    pretty much just about any kind of food you could be in the mood for academics are cool  a lot of professors really are there to help you if you just take the steps to receive it  the thing i don t like is there isn t a lot of course variety to me  i mean they try to add a little spice to their classes but it could definitely use some improvement have to love it  arlington is probably one of the best locations to place a university  with the texas rangers and cowboy stadium close by  the city is always packed with new and interesting people and going to sports bars on game nights is one of the most exciting experience i ve had  another great attraction close by is six flags over texas  i don t think i have ever gotten so much use out of my season pass there  i love living in arlington and i would gladly recommend this school and location to anyone internship and scholastic opportunities â€“ aside lectures that students are given on subject areas  it is important to expose them to hand on experience in the field  this is more achieved from internship opportunities  as an engineering major  i will like to partake in internship programs especially during summer  ut arlington college of engineering has a great  career center which helps students in finding a place  later in the semester i plan to speak with a career counselor at the center which will put me through and guide me on how to go about getting a summer internship in a company that will meet my qualifications and interest rnut arlington as a research institution and very good engineering program makes very good effort to encourage scholarship and make various funding available for graduate studies and research  i am a beneficiary of one of such and it is an encouragement on motivation to learning parking on ut arlington campus is usually difficult from     pm  there are not enough parking spaces compared to number of cars  but the authority is making good efforts as new parking garages are constructed from time to time  there s no public transport system in the city of arlington which makes it necessary for each student  members of faculty and staff to have their own cars  which on the other hand also create a need to parking lots to serve this need  members of faculty and staff usually stand better chances of parking because of more available parking lots open to them in the school premises  students on the other hand has less advantage of parking and it may take sometimes at peak hours to locate a place to park  parking in the wrong car park does attract a fine of    ut arlington is located in arlington which is the   th largest city in the united states  the school is a public comprehensive  teaching and research institution  the city is semi urbane in the heart of the dallas forth worth metropolex  ambiance in the city is cool and encourage studies at both at baccalaureate and graduate levels  depending on an individual  the city will fit so much for different types of people from fun loving to nerdish individuals  with clubs around to socialize and reading facilities to encourage learning rncity of arlington is home of the dallas cowboys and texas rangers  which makes it a hub of sport in texas and the country at large  the city of arlington is safe for living and studies with crime rate below average national crime ratei have to give props to uta s financial aid office  i heard from a couple of my friends who applied for financial aid about how uta gave them more than enough money to head out for college  which is excellent  uta s financial aid office is rather quick with its procedures and rarely do you have to wait for an extended amount of time to receive your money  well done ut arlington like many public colleges also has their own designated transportation bus that runs all day long to get students from one end of the campus  to the other  all  waiting  locations have a nice bench and a roof while you wait and the bus has a more  modern  feel  very comfortable and convenient  not many students take advantage of the bus  probably because the school is not really that large   if a student ever feels threatened  they have the option to ride with a local police officer to get to his or her apartment complex or any other spot  i believe the uta bus is free which is even more convenient  however  what i do not like is how the city of arlingtion does not have any form of public bus transportation  besides some bus that takes you to the dallas cowboys stadium  since alrington does not have a public bus transportational service  it makes is inconvenient for students and older adults who cannot drive the school newspaper informs students about recent crime activity around the campus and advices students to report crimes  even the slightest ones  there are  emergency  buttons all around the campus  so those are pretty useful for students who feel threatened at night  the school also hosts meetings with uta s police chief and speak on current safety issues and what to do in case of an emergency  at orientation  studenta are given a large manual that deals with safety precautions and the like  there has been many reported thefts within the campus  like several laptops were stolen within a few months   so they need to omprove that  what i noticed is the lack of cameras  my high school had cameras all over the place  yet i have not seen a single security camera latched anywhere around campus  perhaps an investment on that could assist with fighting off crimes  since i live off campus  i cannot give an accurate description if i feel  safe  in this college campus  but i suppose the area isn t so bad after all drugs isn t really the problem  not really big since everybody in college is somewhat getting mature  just drinking on the weekends mostly at parties too there are many sports that many people can do  we don t really have a football team there  so not much school spirited going on  just frat groups and their parties  i know that we have basketball  tennis courts  swim team  triathlon  baseball  soccer  and many more sports the school is a great big university  has a great engineering and nurse program  if you go to class and pay attention  getting to know the professor better than you basically pass the class it gets old â€“ the cafe food is pretty much the same everyday so it gets old and you end up spending your money elsewherenumber   nursing school â€“ we have the    nursing school in texas it is competitive but worth the while where is the party â€“ there is really no parties on campus  and if they are they are super lame  you can make the night fun with the people you hang out with not looking for husband come here â€“ the african american male population is relativity low  so i doubt i will find my husband here  there is a major population of asians and indians  so if your into that uta is the place to bepolitical science  pre law â€“ it s fairly easy to get into my program  you have to establish a strategic study plan to endure all of the reading but those who have work ethic should be able to be very successful in my program chicken express and babe s chicken â€“ the restaurant   chicken express  provides a welcoming staff that supports our university  the provide student discounts to all students as long as they come prepared with a student i d  this is very helpful and generous because is expensive and every penny saved counts  in retrospect  all college students are thankful to restaurants like chicken express that provide these privileges  another place that offers great dining is babe s chicken  the staff and over all atmosphere are very welcoming  the food is excellent and cooked home style so as a customer you don t get the feel of eating at a restaurant but rather eating at home with family and friends  most college students appreciate this attribute due to the lack of home cooking on college campus  education program â€“ the education program at uta is amazing  it s one of the best in the nation  the staff is fun and nice  and have connections for internships and future jobs  and the classes are fun and entertaingamazingly awesome â€“ it s really amazing here  the staff is nice  and make you feel at home  there is a lot of diversity and new experiences that can be made at this univeristythe facilities at uta are really good  they re some buildings that are getting older  but they have quite a bit of modern attributes  they are constantly trying to make the campus more modern and they are succeeding  the gym is amazing and there will be a new sports facility in the spring of      there is tons of transportation around campus and it is fast and convenient  it is also completely free to uta students first year freshman who are biology majors â€“ as a first year freshman i am not completely sure how the work load is  i have not got into my intended degree as i have been finishing up my basic requirement  if the biology work load is anything like the workload of my classes it will be just enough but not enough to bog you down arlington hall is the best to be  makes it easy to have new friends start early â€“ always start the financial aid process early  double check everything and ask the aid office for help diverse campus â€“ uta is a very diverse school  the administration seem to make that a priority  walking down the hall to class it is not unusual to hear several groups of people speaking different languages  i have not noticed problems with acceptance or problems because of economic background uta has good facilities such as the new mac athletic center maverick activity center   a centrally located main library  with branches in other areas of the campus  and a student center with food options and meeting spaces  but some of these things are far from where students general have classes  which can make doing somethings between classes hard whatever you want is within a   minute driving radius pretty good  there is a lot of variety on campus  within the normal cafeteria there is also a large variety  basically whatever you want you can probably have it not that bad â€“ if you need something it s probably available  besides having to pay for printing uta offers everything you would need to succeed for free i love it â€“ i love uta  i love bed races  i love the people here  everyone is so nice and friendly too far sometimes â€“ they are within walking distance but they are pretty far to go in between classes  college park will help with new places to eat at rnit does give a variety to walk to a different place we have campus transportation  but arlington  texas does not have a city bus system  so you have to call a buddy if you want to go anywhere other than school no football but great facilities and basketball â€“ even though there is not a football team in the university   we have the dallas cowboys  the basketball and volleyball teams are great and fun to watch   uta just got a new stadium and is building another one   can not wait   bums and untouchables â€“ uta has a great  beautiful school and atmosphere during the school day   but it seems about twice a month a mugging occurs   nothing violent  just these untouchables ask to borrow your phone  which you do because you are nice  and the person walks off  back to their car   and when you ask for your phone back  they pull out a gun and say   its mine now   and you are thankful you did not get hurt   if you live on campus you have to be careful when walking around because the life shelter  homeless shelter  is close by  but it is a great school with a great engineering program do you like long walks  parking is spread out to the outter reaches of campus  it is cheaper than other schools and is still below      for the whole school year  there was a spike in population from        students to        students with a decrease in parking spaces due to new construction  the reason why it still rates at a b  is because the campus is trying and has various shuttles that circulate throughout the outter parking lots to the inner parts of the campus with return trips as well this is not a party school  students come here to get an education that can transform their lives  if you want to party hardy  then go somewhere else  it is just worth it in this economy to sacrafice your grades for a cheap beer buzz no football â€“ the university became a part of a new conference in       basketball teams  yes  all of them  are good  but no football team exists on this campus  this is a huge element missing from uta  the good part is  academics are high and most people are focused on attaining a degree  if you struggle with grades  then you will always be able to find a classmate who will lend a helping hand off campus   pros and cons â€“ pros of off hosing campus is privacy  no need to share  and your preference of cleanliness  cons would be they can be very expensive and safety could be an issue  living on campus provides you with security and on campus police throughout the day but not at apartments  also commuters have a horrible time finding parking spots every morning  so being able to live on campus as far as parking is a advantage came home â€“ the best part of transferring to uta  was coming back close to home  i love being close to my family more than i realized jason s deli â€“ always the best place to grab lunch between classes a good school â€“ university of texas at arlington is a good school  i only have experience with the science and biology departments but most of the teachers know their stuff  the tutoring and other  free   help outside of class is great the campus has a no tobacco policy but many students and faculty continue to smoke and there are no conciseness living on â€“ the on campus housing ranges extremely  there are some that are really nice  but others are questionable in there cleanliness  i also dislike the rule that if you live in the nicer halls you have to buy a meal plan  i do not believe that should a requirement i don t live on campus but i do know that fuzzy s tacos is a popular place for uta students  it also know that the arlington highlands is not far from campus  and there are several places to eat that are really good  it has a diverse selection of restaurants and other places to hang out quiet and individualized â€“ arlington is between two big downtown cities which are dallas and fort worth  and we have the biggest football stadium in u s  cowboy stadium  university of texas at arlington is really close from the local places night life â€“ there are a lot of great places to go to have a great time in the dallas fort worth area  however  the only downside is the commute if you live close to the school or on campus  your best bet is to get a cab on campus living is very convenient for the most part  however  one has to deal with all the freshman jokers pulling fire alarms during the night   other than that  it is well worth it the computers on campus are easily accessible   there are plenty of computers on campus in the library as well as the study lounge with more than enough software for any assignment given in a particular class   the engineering department lab has loads of engineering software as well as mathematical software such as mathematica and matlab   i have never had a problem with any of the computers on campus or with accessing one in between with food â€“ arlington is located in the middle of dallas and forth worth  their is a mall ten minutes away from the university and many restaurants to eat process was bumpy â€“ i got a good amount of financial aid  but the process was very annoying and time consuming  i would constantly get letters in the mail telling me to add more things to my application  and some didn t even make sense  i wish it was as easy as they say it barely snows here  but when it does  it is taken seriously  we once had no classes for a full week  leaving everyone worried and anxious about being able to still learn all the material for tests parking is only busy in the morning  but by afternoon  most students have left  leaving the best parking open safe campus â€“ i feel always secure on campus  i can walk at midnight and i feel confortable to do it it s  a safe areathe academics is really good here the engineering program is really great  the only reason that the university ranks so low is because of the graduation date  this is not a party university by any means  if you are serious about academics then you will do good here  many people don t graduate not because that school is not good but because they are not serious about the study and can t take up the load all my classes are in the social work building   there s not that many social work majors  but all the engineering students park in that lot as well  i don t think they have parking  and it s awful   the first day of class i circled the lot for over an hour   missed that class   everyday i have to make sure to have    minutes of time carved out for parking   one of my classes is from       pm and parking is non existent  except in the faculty section   wide open spaces   but can t park there until  p m   can t park at another lot because we get out of class at  pm and we re not at the best part of campus  closest lot is a   minute walk    i ve seen campus security in the lot when i get out of class once this semester   everything is unlit and abandoned   i grew up in a huge city  lived downtown  i m not afraid of my own shadow   but screw walking to my car at   p m  at that school    my other classes are at     if i find parking within    minutes i consider myself very lucky   all the lots are packed at this time  so while i don t have to worry about walking alone for   minutes in a tree filled  more places for people to hide imo   unlit street at  p m     it wouldn t matter   i d just be circling another lot   get more parking  seriously   it s beyond ridiculous   i ve never been to a school with this much of a parking problem   thanks for the parking garages all the way across campus  but the social work parking lot needs to be expanded  big time it is very easy to get internships at uta  my school is very highly valued and several employers come to try and recruit here there have been a couple of small crimes committed on campus  however with all the available blue posts that can be used to call utapd  i still feel relatively safe greek life makes a significant impact by always grilling food for students walking to class and throwing great parties  but besides that i know little about them as a member of a spirit group i have plenty of experience at games at our school and it is always a blast motivating everyone to cheer on our school teams i may not have any other college to compare it to  but i can confidently say that i love uta and everything about it  my favorite experiences so far have been the time i ve spent as a member of a spirit group called the wranglers the community had a wonderful vibe that made me want to stay there the overall experience i have had is really great  the people are so culturally diverse  the staff is very helpful  there are many ways to get involved its very challenging but fun at the same timedon t know squat about ithandicapped basket ball and cross country athletes are always winning something i ve made great friends connections here it is okay to be here  it is texas state university so the tuition fee is affordable if you attend with instate tuition fee  and this university has awesome gym as good as class of ultra sport of    hour fitness in irvine in california  they have good engineering and nursing major system there were a couple burglar incidentsit has a great science program not everyone stays on campus so the campus was kind of dead at times almost anyone can join if you can pay has everything and even the athletes use it from time to time  great opportunity for nursing majorsreally chill school   lot of commutersmostly standard college classes  some excelit s one of the most diverse campuses in texas  excellent nursing program with a     nclex passing rate  great basketball teams  in the entertainment city  lots of cultural events  a decent amount of students in class  we are making progress towards increasing the retention rate  it s inexpensive  close to dfw it s in the entertainment city  however the downtown atmosphere seems unsafe and old  i wish they can improve downtown arlington  overall  the college academics are great  however the commuting atmosphere makes the school seem so plain  i want them to build more dorms  i was put on the waiting list for dorms  the diversity is great  and the cultural events are entertaining  everyone seems friendly and the school has an excellent reputation for it s basketball and nursing program  they are also making a new building called the college park center yes uta is like most universitys  were they only the best and try to work with you so you can get there  don t get me wrong either they or verry strict in our gpa  keeping your greads up and actually been in class ore the things their inforcing to be honest i have not lived in a dorm or anything close to the college i live about      min away from it  but i can say that will i been in school u can tell is a better to stay in campus and be more close to the school its way easier  the social atmosphere is great at uta you can meet so many different type of people from all around the country  in the future im hopping to get a dorm in school their very nice and clean so why not  i will like to expirance the life in the dorms  from the stories they told me its pretty good architecture is awesome  i have no regrets so far being in the architecture program  although i had to drop a few times i have retaken those classes and everything has worked out for the better  i am concerned about finding a job once i graduate  there are not too many positive things i hear about finding work out in the field not only do you see people of different ethnicity at uta but individuals with very interesting backgrounds  i know a guy who looks asian but he is from ecuador and speaks fluent spanish  i have friends who come from other parts of the world  russia  dubai  sri lanka  nipoli  japan   and so much more  i love being surrounded by all kinds of different people architecture   the most difficult yet greatest experience in my life â€“ architecture at uta is a very rigorous program filled with all nighters  hard work  and sometimes even impossible deadlines  i have had to drop classes a few times because of the work load and also working part time  although it has been a difficult journey  i have learned so much about architecture through different professors  students  design build program  and trips to other places  architecture for me has been an awesome experience so far and i enjoy every moment the process was easy  i applied for a federal loan during the application period  i wish they would have given opportunities for scholarships and grants  as well very hard to find parking spots beyond the early morning  should you come in during the rush hour you can expect to spend       minutes looking for a place or alternatively parking very far away decent  but somewhat restricted â€“ while there s a good variety of options  the problem is that the food court does not work very well on those days when you are doing long hours and happen to have a class just before the food court closes get caught  and you re out â€“ school policies for underage drinking and drug use include loss of housing and loss of education at uta not much clubs nearby â€“ there s a few in arlington about      minutes away  but if you want to go to a decent one  you ll have to go to dallas which is about    minutes away arlington hall dorms â€“ this is my second year here at uta s arlington hall  the dorms provide good amenities such as study rooms on each floor  a fully equipped kitchen for cooking  laundry rooms on each floor  lounge rooms with t v  and sitting area on each floor  a great room with t v   pool and ping pong tables  and sitting areas  basketball court on one side and sand volleyball on the other side  housekeeping services  wi fi services  and etc  social atmosphere could be better  the cost is affordable  about     a month with no extra bills  and the location is very convenient  the hall is located close to the university center  bookstore  and many of the buildings for classes  application for housing is simple  but there s a long waiting list for the dorms  if you re not a freshman returning resident  there s a likely chance that you will not be able to get a room i commute  trying to find a parking spot in the morning until  pm is difficult and time consuming lacks school spirit â€“ what i would call a degree factory  a major street runs through the center of campus and not much school spirit  crime is also a problem  i must have received   police bulletins in the first month of the semester  including someone being robbed at gunpoint  i have already planned my transfer off campus varies â€“ the apartments near campus can be inexpensive  but run down and high crime   in order to have a great time  you have to move driving distance to be safe  but still great town  great prices  lots of fun university hall dining â€“ this dining experience lets you see your fellow students and eat a great meal  whether you want american dining or something different  ut arlington has it  plus it has very close fast food choices in downtown arlington  texas student involvement here are very high spirited  the teams are very diverse  the facilities  especially with the newly renovated gymnasium is state of the arts  i just recently got back into going to the gymn after    years of inactivity and help me with my    years of drug addiction  thanks so much uta     the uta s computer labs are up to date with printing  network reliability and speed  wireless access and all related matters in dealing with computer technology are awesome  the staffers are very courteous  helpful and competent uta is located within walking distance to downtown arlington  this area has been under constant renovations  the museum  ama  and all other public venues are great to visit  go mavericks    on line course â€“ although i am an on line learner  the university of texas keeps me aware of their sports and tries to get everyone to support the teams i am not sure how the local weather affects the school  i do know that newsletters are sent whenever school is closed for weather on line education â€“ i currently attend campus via the on line program however  we do get weekly newsletters that address the no tolerance position there are branches of dining chains within walking distance of the campus  with prices comparable to those in other branches   but i have not seen any student discount never heard of it  there is a lack of communication concerning this point at uta  i would like to participate in an internship program later on  i think that you can learn a lot and grow by being an intern busy busy busy â€“ there is always a party somewhere  arlington highlands is also a party on its own  transport sucks though apartments rule  even though apartments may be a bit more expensive  you have much more freedom to do what you want both in and around the apartment  amenities are much better as well it is going awesome so far  uta is the place for me  i m not really into the nightlife  but i do enough hanging out with my friends and there are plenty of spots on campus to do that just enough â€“ at the beginning of the year it is alway over crowded and extremely hard to find a parking space  but several lots are have been made and a new garage go to dallas â€“ the nightlife at uta is pretty dead  other than on greek row or apartment all the partying is going on in dallas get learning environment and professors  i ve had some great professors at uta that are willing to work with you and don t just read off a powerpoint  in the smaller class of about       student there are many class discussions and group activities  the university offers many ways for some extra help  such as tutoring  writing center and si sessions  rneven though i find the academics great at uta  it isn t perfect and some areas need work small town atmosphere  other than on campus recreational facilities  cowboys stadium and a few other places most of the attractions are in the neighboring city  dallas  especially  when it comes to night life a crowded sea â€“ the college of nursing at ut arlington has grown exponentially over the past years  the number of students who are accepted pales in contrast to the number of students who apply  it is somewhat stressful with the deadlines and waiting period to find out whether or not you were accepted  however  they do clearly outline what will make you competetive when you apply so you have a good idea of what you need in order to to gain admission extensive options in education â€“ ut arlington has a broad spectrum of majors and fields of study for prospective students  whether pursuing an undergraduate  graduate  or post graduate degree  the colleges within ut arlington are more than capable of meeting any educational needs or desires in and around arlington â€“ arlington is nestled right between dallas and fort worth  making a trip to either both quick and convenient  arlington draws visitors from both of these nearby cities  with a wide variety of entertainment options  from theme parks to sports franchises  nightlife to dining  arlington has so much to offer great school  i love this school and i am very satisfied and i would definitely choose it if i had to all over again there are plenty of different ethnicities and interests among the students at uta  i think any student would fit in with at least one group i do not live on campus   but i know  a lot of people who do and they are very happy and well rounded nursing program â€“ this program is amazing at uta  we have our own smart hospital with state of the art mannoquins and everything is extremely realistic great nursing program â€“ all of my teachers so far have been amazing  the classes are all very beneficial and i have really connected with a lot of my professors  they have all been very fair great university â€“ uta is anawesome school  the campus is pretty and very comfortable  the teachers are great and they honestly care about you  i love it here i am a biology major and that s a hard major to persue but uta pushes to go do your best at everything and reach your goal  there is a local hospital couple blocks from the school where pre med students can volunteer a great place to be  university of texas at arlington is one of the best schools around  the school is split in two by a main highway and is surrounded by a lot of restaurants  six flags is literally   minutes from uta school location â€“ i am not surprise there so much crime in this university  almost everyday there are warnings of possible suspects walking around campus  the school is located in the worse part of the city of arlington  just to get to the school is a huge unwanted adventure  having to go through so many traffic lights and never ending traffic  the school is also located beside a high school  numerous shopping centers  the mall the cowboys stadium etc    so you could imagine the odyssey just to get there  the neighborhood is poor and there are many people that mingle into the campus just to steal and cause aggression the atmosphere at nice and i feel like i am at home  i don t even feel homesick as much i don t want to graduate â€“ i love uta  i am so happy that i choose to attend uta and it be part of my university experience  the classes are not easy  you have to study to pass and study even more to excel  here at uta students come from all parts of the world to sit in one class room and learn  but also teach us how to be well balanced individuals say no to drugs but i ll take a drink instead  uta is pretty much a anti drug campus  but  texans never say no to a free drink killing brain cells â€“ nightlife at uta consists of drinking  drinking  and  drinking  when students say lets party  in other words they are saying  i want to get wasted   arlington highlands has a few bars that the older students like to go but with the cost of tution they tend to just stay on campus pretty good â€“ most of the place on campus are good  there is a lot of variety in things you could eat helping hand â€“ the professors at uta are pretty helpful  all of the professors i have had have been more than willing to help me out when ever i needed extra help  as far as the classes go  they move at a pretty decent pace  they are not so fast that you will be lost if you miss a class or two but you definately need to study to keep upi think the one cool thing about uta is that the students that attend college here are so friendly  you see some of the same faces and you get pretty comfortable at this campus pretty fast the location where uta is at is great  you have places like chipotle  chili s  razoos and lost of other fast food places to go  therefore it s very convenient  the cost isn t that bad if you wanna go for some cheap fast food  and you at least get a    percent student discount if you are around that area as long as you show them your uta id card physician assistant â€“ i have recently changed my my major in order to become a physician assistant  there is a lot of responsibility when it comes to this specific major  my gpa has to be at least a      i am currently the vice president of the circle k club  community service  and i will be working  this is no easy task  but i am willing to commit to one day reach an fulfill my dreams like any university  the weather can always be a factor in terms of your experience on campus  you have to travel to classes  thus having to walk outside in the rain  heat  snow  etc  texas is know for its crazy and unpredictable weather conditions each season  at least there are several trees that provide lots of shade for students  and the buildings are all air conditioned  safe and healthy for us as students school is now tobacco free â€“ i suppose this is mainly for the health concern  recently uta has announced it will be tobacco free campus as a whole  to tobacco users  or smokers  i suppose they may feel a bit indifferent about the new policy but truthfully it was much debated over time  uta works with the student government frequently to take in the opinions and voices of its students and faculty to see what they can improve on  what can be changed  i find that an important asset to the university because it cares about making the campus more enjoyable and efficient for all its members overall uta does a great job  i enjoy going to school  i enjoy being involved with the maverick community  i think it s a great institution and choice for anyone going to college  they work hard to meet the students need  and reach satisfaction from many of us ut arlington safety â€“ safety and security  is important to the staff and students  all ways getting updates in emails about a crime on campus and tips for things not getting stolennot much â€“ i do not know much because  i am only taken my bacis  the fall semester will be the start of my major classes required for my programit s a diverse campus â€“ their are a lot of different culture on this campus  and we all get along  very well never have used the computer labs â€“ i have never used the computer labs at the university of texas at arlington  there s never been a need for me to do so they want you to succeed â€“ the professors i have had at the university of texas at arlington have been great  they are professional  kind  very attentive towards the students objectives  and helpful in answering any questions a student may have regarding school work or any other topic  i have heard several professors mention during orientation their desire to help each and every student succeed with their studies i have been looking for a fraternity for a while now  there are so many choices  anyone can find their fit here  they throw some good parties  and pretty much anyone can go  a lot of charitable work is done by greeks  so they have a good impact on the community  they have some nice homes down greek row hot girls galore â€“ most of the girls dress to impress every day  there won t be a day where you don t see an attractive girl walking by  guys dress in the typical style  shorts  tshirt  perhaps the occasional hipster  everyone is pretty much from dfw  so city people  we do have a significant number of country guys and girls though  it is texas after all the geology department is small  but that is what makes it great  there are many research projects going on  and undergraduates are welcome to help  it really gives students opportunities to immerse themselves in the field due to it s small size  this would be a rarity in bigger campuses due to the large number of students  the professors get to know you on a personal level and truly care about your education  it is more than i had ever hoped for professors and classes â€“ all the teachers are great and the classes really help you with your major relatively satisfied  i did my classes online   we communicated with academic coach more than the teachers   the classes were   weeks long and a lot of materials were covered during that time period   it was hectic but i am glad i was done with my bsn in    months parking is atrocious between the main class hours  mon  fri  between  a  p   after that  everyone starts clearing out  its funny though b c over the weekends  the parking lots are like a ghost town b c so many people go home pretty good options â€“ there are quite a few options for any type of apartment you prefer but they can be pricey  johnson creek crossing    the newly built midtown apartments are both fully furnished with most bills paid    the amenities are pretty legit  if you want to go w  a cheaper option  there are campus apartments such as timber brook    arbor oaks but you have to furnish them yourself    i m not too sure on how many bills you have to pay yourself  maverick place and centennial court are within walking distance but you have to cross super busy cooper st  to get to class    that s no fun  also  stay away from centennial  i ve heard nothing but bad things about the place  ghetto  bad interior  etc    so  if you have to stay across cooper st  go with maverick place  there are also many options that are a farther distance but i don t know too much about those except don t live there if you don t have a car for the most part  the academics at uta are pretty great  if you re in the nursing program  you re definitely getting a top of the line education b c our program is one of the best in the nation  you have your fair share of classes that are difficult    you have your blow off classes  watch out for the classes with foreign professors though   those are always a killer social atmosphere â€“ arlington is a great city to live in whether living in a dorm  apartment  or with family imaginary bus stops â€“ the transportation at uta has a good reputation  but the areas to be picked up at are not very practical  the buses can be seen several times throughout the day but i ve never actually seen people get on or off of them  as far as i know  the places to get on them are around the stadium and i have never once had to park anywhere near there the mac â€“ the maverick activity center at uta is amazing  with two olympic sized pools three fabulous indoor tracks  this facility offers a great environment for students to stay healthy and active a challege â€“ the academics offered at the university of texas at arlington are worthy of notice  each class promises challenge and hard work  most teachers are great and have a real passion for their topic of study  the workload can be a bit much at times  but advisors do their best to make sure each student only takes on as much as he or she can handle  though some areas could use improvements  such as the registration process and tas  the university of texas at arlington truly offers curriculum that prepares students for the competitive careers ahead of them the college is a public school  therefore there are not many rules it has a very good level of academic  the standars are high with great staff the best fitness center i know â€“ the maverick activities center  or the mac  as we call it  is my favorite place on the ut arlington campus  with state of the art fitness equipment  on site trainers  an indoor track  swimming pool  rock climbing wall  and soccer field  i have everything i need to ensure that i keep optimum health   and have fun doing it my academic experiences â€“ i would recommend the university of texas at arlington to anyone who would listen  registration is a simple  generated online process  the campus is smaller than others  but the layout is beautiful  all of the buildings have up to date facilities  and everything is accesible  every professor that i have come in contact with is exemplary in the field s  he she teach es   i enjoy attending class  and enjoy listening to the lectures   no  not lectures  more like detailed discussions that captivate me  and hold my attention  of course  nothing is perfect  but uta sure does come close wish i knew â€“ i commute to campus  and work a part time job to cover what my financial aid does not  unfortunately  i haven t had the opportunity to be very involved on campus  however  i have several friends that have joined greek life and even work on campus  and i m totally jealous  there s always something going on  be it a basketball game  free movie night  or concert  i m working on saving up to move closer to school so i can really check out campus life at uta wet and windy  during the stormy seasons  the campus will sometimes flood  which is a real pain if you re not wearing the right shoes  the winds can also be very strong between buildings  but the weather is generally nice in that area  and you can often find students outside chatting with friends or playing frisbee great people  tons of help  i am still a freshman  but my experience at uta so far has been very interesting  my first semester  i joined a biology freshman interest group  fig   and it was great  it s a class full of other freshman who are taking essentially the same classes as you   so forming study groups was super easy  i had to work a lot and so i was unable to attend many of them  but overall the program was very helpful  my science professors have been great  they expect a lot from you  and the workload is heavy  but it will only help in the long run  we have tutors and clinics available when we need help  which is a huge plus as well  in the coming year i hope to move closer to campus so i can utilize more of these great amenities features available â€“ research opportunity is available for students  there are lot of scholarship and extra curricular activities available lounge hall â€“ food is great  have a exclusive dining room as well as the regular fast food for students who wish it   its an all inclusive area that caters to the needs of all   meals are delivered accordingly as well health and safety â€“ uta safelty approach in matters such as storm management and general student safety is top of the line that ensures student and faculty safety first before all  also the provision of having an health center on campus and health facilities improves the general health of the students  never felt unsafe while on campus  incidents have occured but the police is always on hand to walk one to the car finance major â€“ finance is a good major of study at uta  lots of classes and help with those classes that present a challenge to most students  for me i had an experience where a class was really hard to comprehend the dynamics of the case study but with the help of the professor and other students we were able to pass the class whoich shows uta commitment to positive learning find people with many diversities yet feel comfortable if you do fafsa on time  the school offers pretty good scholarships  especially with a high gpa  the office is helpful and finds ways to help there are parties at least once a week  the school is also good about throwing events for students  its close to clubs  bars  bowling  skating  parks mall  restaurants and all sorts of things to have fun there are many computer labs around campus and even inside of the dorms  there are also places to print and students can rent laptops at the library  the internet speed is great and the computers are up to date with needed software already provided alot of sports but no football â€“ there is no football team  but that s in the future i hear  there are alot of other sports and sports activities daily  there is also church in the mav center on sunday mornings apartment on campus â€“ the new dorms are very nice  but small  the apartments on campus have   per apartment  but everyone has their own room and share a bathroom with one other person much to do â€“ arlington is a town in the middle of the dfw metroplex  with six flags over texas  water park  dallas cowboy and ranger stadium  there are shopping malls and   walmarts close by  many restaurants are near it is a nice place to learn and meet new and excellent peopleparking is hard fine when u want a close parking to the building but it a lot of space in the back but its far to walkthey are nice guys at uta and very smart ones too not to much drugs  at uta i have not seen any  druggies   smoking is a huge problem at uta  their everywhere  hopefully uta will be a smoke free campus soon way to much indian students â€“ at uta their are many different types of people  although our student body consists of mostly people from india i m part of the college of science and i love everything about it  i love learning about the brain and development and the true importance of psychology and science as a whole the job opportunities â€“ there are multiple job opportunities at uta that pay pretty well  and they re flexible around your class times the parks at arlington â€“ the parks at arlington is a nearby mall within a mile to the university that provides students with close proximity stores and a giant food court with acceptable prices maverick activity center â€“ the maverick activity center is a state of the art and brand new building that lets students work out and play basketball or soccer for free on campus  a lot of students call it the macpainful fiancial aid process â€“ receiving financial aid is a very long and annoying process  it takes a lot of work to get people to follow through with you and your awards drinking and drugs â€“ the drug scene at ut arlington is not that big  drinking is more popular  this occurs mostly at parties on campus living â€“ the dorms in the university of texas at arlington are a great way of meeting new friends and getting to experience life as a student grade replacement policy â€“ overall i thinked they worked with you academically  except for the grade replacement policy change that did not make amends for students who started before the transition in       totally screwed me my senior year sports are not big â€“ we don t even have a football team   we seriously lacked in this area  the basketball team did have a few good seasons while i was there it was great from a convenience standpoint initially  but you get tired of it and alot of the choices are pricey  there are better options and discounts available off campus there are no buses in arlington  but there is an on campus shuttle that will take you anywhere you need to go  with stops at key locations on campus near classes  the gym  and the cafe not noticeable â€“ i barely even notice the greeks  they have their own housing on the west side of the campus  a little out of the way  if you join  its seems pretty fun  but if you don t  you ll barely notice them at all could be better â€“ the immediate area surrounding the college is not very good  it s run down and offers limited or no attractions  the area doesn t give off a very safe vibe either  but the campus police do their job well enough to keep you safe if you stay on campus  however  it is close to dallas and fort worth  where you could find anything you re looking for  entertainment  recreation  etc parking kind of sucks right now  but we are getting   new parking garages pretty soon  parking permits are worth it  you can easily rack up on parking fines and if you don t pay you could possibly get towed  get a permit   getting better â€“ arlington overall isn t too safe of a place after dark  but the campus does provide special security measures to help prevent crime  the police do try to keep our campus safe  it is getting better  this past semester there has been less crime reports  there will be crime on any college campus love at second sight â€“ my very first time stepping on the campus  summer during freshman orientation  i was like  why am i here   after being here   years i love this place and wouldn t leave it  it is so easy to make friends and the campus is great  if you pick the right crowd to hang with your time at uta will be the best time of your life apartment party â€“ there is always a weekend party at certain apartment complexes  involves a lot of drinking  frat daddy s quot â€“ you will know a  frat daddy  when you see one   they all pretty much hangout on the  th floor of the library i don t know much about uta housing as i live at home  but it is obviously extremely expensive and quite a hassle  i do not recommend it the professors at uta are all likable and knowledgeable  there is a wide variety of subjects to study and options to pursue there is usually an abundance of computers and there is no limit on time  it is possible to do work and or projects on them  however  it is personal preference to instead own a private laptop foreign students â€“ there are a lot of foreign students at uta  it makes the university unique because they accept a lot of students from other countries  which adds the flavor of the school weather is usually not a big problem  it is very hot around summer time  and it gets cold  but it is typical for texas boring library  with typical floors of books and computers  there are many cubicles to use to study  however they are for the most part very small the security is reinforced  we may have other issues going on campus such as alcohol on campus  but as far as i know my entourage don t use any drugs  and if we don t bring any alcohol on campus  guys   girls â€“ we have a variety of people coming from around the world especially from nepal   india  most of us are trying to get along each others  everybody dress pretty dissent extremely simple â€“ applied for the school  received scholarship  have to do very little work to receive scholarship money every semesternothing special â€“ lack of school spirit means very little athletic support on campus  baseball and wheel chair basketball are really the only sports worth going to games for  however all games are free for studentsvery diverse students   professors â€“ very diverse student body  professors from quite a few different backgrounds  accounting classes are the most difficult  workload is fairly reasonable  too many professors with poor english skills  business building is nothing speciali love the arlington dfw atmosphere  with the theme parks and plenty of yummy food places and shopping areas its pretty hard to beat they have great working computers as well as the internet  the library environment is very cozy  you can always find a spot  most of the students do have their own laptops but for those who dont  they dont have to spend their money to buy one  the labs have enough computers to serve the needs to many my school â€“ so far my experience here has been okay  most people who go here are commuters so it is difficult to meet new people the best thing about uta is the price it is a lot cheaper than most schools heavy traffic in the mornings when coming from ft worth on     it usually takes me      min to get to school from haltom city  there is no public transportation that will take you too school  only on campus buses  i haven t lived in off campus apartments yet because of pricing  parking is a pain to find anytime of the day  campus police are always present  very safe environment i can t event tell there is a greek life if there is one this school has great diversity  much more than the undergraduate school i attended   this really helps with meeting and understanding a variety of people from different cultures and backgrounds school policies â€“ this school policies are not strict  you dont have a time you have to go to bed  there is no specific rules on bringing guest or family members  your basically an adult and responsible for balancing your academic and social lives being underage and wanting to go to clubs can seem frustrating  but there is always a party where students rent somewhere  it is always fun  you might have to drive a little far from campus but not too far  but its always worth it campus crime â€“ the campus security is great  the only main crime here is sometimes you hear loud music other then that you are safe  the school also has buttons you can press all around campus so that in the unfortunate event that you are atacked  you can press it and campus police will be there in no time due to the bad weather conditions that hit arlington this winter  classes were cancelled for a weekthere are many places within the boundaries of the school  where students can go to buy different foodsmy school is located on the busiest street in the city of arlington  because of this  many people have opened different restuarant to attract customers who use the street  there are different cuisine from different parts of the world and because the city of arlington is known as a college town  most of these restuarants have been built within a five to ten miles radios around the school texas is horrible in general â€“ the campus has alot of fun activites but sometimes texas s crazy weather gets in the way there is no football    so there is no regular homecoming and homecoming is not very seriousguys are  cute â€“ most of them are city guys and are cute but their shyness is a problem greeks are everywhere â€“ all of the fraternities sororites recruit outside the university center with posters  grilling  handing out free stuff  they re everywhere you look  you can t go a day without seeing a fraternity trying to rushnearby food places â€“ at ut arlington  there is a wendy s  mcdonalds  two subways  taco bell  golden chick  and donut palace all nearby the campus  there are more but i cannot recall all of them  some offer student discounts  but more often than not i forget to ask about it  you won t go hungry  there s fast food within walking distance of uta  and lots of varietystudent academic evaluation â€“ some professors actually care about their students  and some do not  here at ut arlington  i have had my share of poor professors  and excellent professors  as for the curriculum  if you can follow the professor  and have adequate background knowledge  you won t struggle with the material nor workload drug scene â€“ i don t know a lot about any drug problems at uta  but everyone smokes  there are cigarette butts all over campus  and of course there is underage drinking going on i don t really participate in this kind of stuff  but from what i have heard  the bars around here are pretty sleazy  and there are no clubs in arlington  the only thing i do know is good is hookah lounges food places on campus â€“ we have a lot of places to eat at  chick fil a  panda express  einstein s bagels  pizza hut  sushic  subway  starbucks  but when you have been here a few years  it kinda gets old  i live off campus so i only grab a bite if i m really hungry wonderful learning experience â€“ uta is a great school  especially for what i am studying  i have very much enjoyed my experience so far  i have made many friends and the professors are easy to get in touch with better apartments are further away â€“ most of the off campus housing near the campus is not so desirable  but if you go a little northeast of the campus  the apartment selction is better  you might pay more  but the apartments are in better condition and are safer attractions and shopping â€“ the university of texas at arlington is located near many different attraction  it is only a few miles from the dallas cowboys stadium  texas ranger s stadium and six flags over texas  also  the parks mall and the arlington highlands are great places to shop nearby very safe school â€“ the school is very safe and we have a lot of security always walking arounfinternship program â€“ my school has an internship program that has allowed me to seek career opportunities and get a little bit of experience  also  arlington is a very entertaining city with places like six flags  cowboy s stadium  hurricane harbor  and the ball park in arlington campus living â€“ i do not live on campus  it is rather costly and i only live    minutes away from campus  so i figured commuting would be a better option it takes getting in very early  before  am to find even a decent spot because the sports fill up fast and sometimes it seems that people won t give up their spots even when their class has let out  other drivers also aren t that polite when it comes to finding an open spot melting pot â€“ there are a hude diverse groups of people from a variety of diffrent backgrounds and the care in making campus wide desions takes into account those very diverse viewpoints there are multiple computer labs all over campus that are accessible to all students at a wide range of times  the labs at the central library are even open on sunday till midnight  its a little tough to find one open during finals and midterms but besides that you are always welcome to go to another lab somewhere else on campus the food in the cafe is pretty much the same every day  some of the things change  but if you want anything good  you ll be eating grilled cheese and pizza for every meal  the only  restaurant  type stuff we have is chick fil a  pizza hut  panda express  and subway  after a while  you get tired of such limited dining options depends what dorm you live in â€“ lipscomb hall is one of the cheapest dorms on the campus  at first  it seemed like although it was an older structure  living there would be fun because of the people  the people at lipscomb socialize much more than those in other dorms such as kc and arlington  however  i came to realize that although i was able to meet several new people  the people i met were not the type of people i d like to befriend  since it s one of the cheapest  i guess that demonstrates why most of the people there are potheads and drinkers  if you like to party and have fun  these are your type of people  there is also a lot of unnecessary drama  and rumors that are just that  rumors  there is a lot of diversity in this school  with many asians  blacks  and hispanics if it were difficult to access scholarship and financial aid at uta  i would not be attending the school  uta makes this process extremely easy and accessible to anyone in need  i have never had difficulty setting up an appointment with a supervisor or financial aid adviser  my situation forces me to apply for as many scholarships and grants as i possibly can  and uta provides me with the resources to continue my education you win some  you lose some â€“ the campus police have no problem giving parking tickets  i ve known students who have been on the edge of being kicked out of school for their insubordination in this respect  however  it is not too difficult to get away with a small get together or party in your on campus apartment  just don t be too relaxed about it uta is not a very well known school but has plenty to offer  if you are interested in sports and outdoor activities  the brand new maverick activities center is the shining pride of the school  also  if you re interests reside in academics  the university offers some really great study areas with tutors  and an excellent campus writing center  lastly  who could forget the university center  critical to on campus social affairs  the uc is a prominent hangout on campus  complete with billiards  a bowling alley  starbucks  and a fully equipped food court  with all your favorite restaurants for the minorities and extremely talented â€“ the campus focuses very strongly on out of country students so much of their scholarships are geared in helping them which leaves any other grants strictly for the top prominent students  this can make receiving small grants highly unlikely for most students bus system for campus â€“ there is a very convenient bus system that stops all around the large parking lots and some of the campus housing to transport students to and from campus basketball  softball and volleyball â€“ work hard  great advertisement and fairly competitive teams my overall experience at uta was good  but i feel like it could be alot better somewhere elsegreek life at uta is pretty much the same as an in any other mid sized campus  only around    of the student population is greek  i ve had a good time as a greek and it definetly gets me more involved around campus  it teaches you to manage your time betterfood spots â€“ they have two spots in the same building one is the dining hall where of course its a buffet but it costs around   bucks if you don t have any kind of meal plan  the other is a spot where they have subway  panda express  pizza hut  chik fil a  and some sushi   the food is good but really pricy security is top notch  there are emergency telephones around every corner and the police force does a very good job of notifying students whenever there is an incident texas is all about the sun â€“ well weather is hardly bad in here   and bad meaning the temperatures being in the low   s and there is snow everywhere  texas is all about the sun like i said  weather is not so awesome because its usually around the    s in summer for almost   months but it doesn t really affect campus experience because people love the sun gotta drive to get the good stuff â€“ school is surrounded by a bunch of ghetto people waiting to have their chance on stealing your purse or mugging you  it s better not to go around at night in arlington itself because we get university police reports of assaults all the time  not too far though is dallas downtown which is a perfect fit for a party animal  got bunch of     clubs and also     clubs for any economic  race  color   around the school are no clubs whatsoever  there are bars but no smoking in bars in arlington   drive to dallas  save the headache of a crappy bar and also being robbed  have the best time of your life uta is full of diverse ethnic and racial faces  economically we could find more people of average income no farraries  scholarships are available equally to everyone i believe but just like any other schools  americans are more favored when offering jobs and grants   but i guess that s a federal thing and not school  i didn t really see anyone implemeting their political beliefs on me as a teacher or a student but i have seen wierd looks toward slightly different people parking permit costs like around      per year and this is a regular parking  if you do not have a parking sticker then you will be getting a ticket of      even though you have a parking sticker it is very difficult to get a parking nearby  as my personal experience  i have parked on the side of other people residential places  and i have to go to school before      am to get the parking even though my class starts only at      am  and i just live   minutes away from school which is ridiculous the campus isn t really strict  it s basically common sense and you should know the rules once you enter the dorms  the strictness is not too strict  but just know the rules and follow them i believe that off campus housing is also a great choice as well  it s living around the campus and also be able to know the neighbors  sometimes you can even have your own room mates once you pick them i have experience the housing by the looks of it that the     bedroom dorms may actually be the best options  but the cost is about       but the students may split it  so the housing is very nice and comfortable guys are cute â€“ types of guys  rockers  country boys  and then just your everyday normal guy mac is the place to be â€“ the facilities are great  especially the mac  or maverick activities center  the gym is huge  with many basketball courts and exercise classrooms  a lot of workout equipment and great wireless service and more  it s a place to get healthy and meet new people  the university center is a great place to be  to just hang out with friends and eat in the cafeteria and the plaza  where there s a subway  chick fil a  and sushi place among the food places  the food is kinda overpriced which is a downside  so try not to eat there too much if possible  the campus activities are pretty good  with numerous organizations on campus to join and be active on campus  greek life is okay  but could always be better  some may say that the campus is boring  but you just have the find something to do to be productive and enjoy college life no    hr computer lab anymore  but worth it â€“ the computer lab that the school once had isn t there anymore  which is a drag  but students can use any of the computers in the library or in one of the academic buildings on campus  the library is always crowded  so sometimes it s hard to find a computer to do homework or to print  and the printers sometimes have problems which annoy the students  it s kinda beneficial to have your own computer and just print on campus if possible  the network speed for on campus computers are pretty good and reliable biology is great  the biology department has different degree plans to follow according to what you want to be  ranging from pre med to medical technology  the advisors are great and are always willing to lend a helping hand when it comes to advice from internships to what classes to take  the workload isn t easy  come on it s biology  but it will be all worth it in the end  job opportunities usually arise from the referral of the biology advisors or the sponsoring clubs that are on campus such as pre pharmacy association and medical students prepatory association lots of place to shop â€“ there is a parks mall near uta  and it s pretty big store and they are on sales many times  there are six flags and hurricane harbor  and cowboy stadiuj near utasearch the downtown â€“ for an expensive cost around      bape is pretty good place to go out for dinner  all the sides are unlimited  main course food is amazingly delicious  this restaurant s interior design and outside design is unbelievably well constructed and organized  anyhow  if you want cheap place  fuzzy s is good place to go too  their nachos and tacos are so goodeach of us unique  all of us empowered   i like going to ut arlington  because it provides me with a variety of course options and timings  i love my on campus job because it helps me out financially  there are a number of hidden opportunities and one has to dig in to find out about them  i wish the academic advisors were a little more helpful and supportive  scholarships are rare for international students and i believe they should offer more we have a very vivid population of students from almost everywhere  asia to africa to south america and middle east  i haven t met a lot of europeans though  i like meeting people from different countries and this is very easy at ut arlington good but not that great  ut arlington has everything a regular reputed university would have  but services like cafeteria and printers could be improved a little bit  also the libraries need to stay open for longer times       public transportation inside the library is must  rest is good the university of texas at arlington tries their best to provide transportation for students around campus  there are many stops for shuttles around the campus that transport students from one destination to the next free of charge  students who cannot afford good parking close to the campus can buy a less expensive parking pass and park somewhere further  however  uta provides shuttles to pick up the students at shuttle stops and take them to the campus  overall  i greatly appreciate uta s afford to help the students drug and alcohol visibility â€“ i must say that the university of texas at arlington s drug and alcohol visibility is excellent  since attending the university in fall of       i have not yet witness a single sign of alcohol or drug usages on campus  i am extremely satisfy with the university s enforcement of drug and alcohol prohibition among the students parking stinks â€“ the parking lot is way too overcrowded  walking to class takes me at least twenty minutes from my car to my first class just because the parking lots are always full and far away from campus athletic facilites â€“ the athletic facilities at my school are great  they provide a lot of equipment for athletes and casual gym go ers to work out on you re on your own â€“ the financial aid office is there and it is quite easy to find  however  if you are going to get any help then you have to get ready the specific question to ask  it was quite surprising to me how unhelpful sometimes they can be  you better off just apply online it s all on the dice â€“ on the campus  the police and security force is very strict especially when it comes to parking  it is definitely not easy getting through the day without a ticket if one is careless  drinking  drug use  speeding  and violence are all under surveillance of the police force  however  due to this  it is extremely safe for the majority of the students and allow great peace of mind  as for the classes  the policies go quite easy there and the professors are all very lenient but strict if you get out of bound simple yet effective â€“ the university have a lot to offer and it have an amazing area for recreation as well as sports  since the college is greatly diverse  it creates an easy atmosphere for everyone and it is definitely not hard to fit in  there are also cafe and small restaurants located in different buildings throughout the school and allow many friends to catch up with each other  overall  the feeling and atmosphere of the university is great and enjoyable the school has many programs and degrees to choose from  the career center is helpful with getting through school and preparing for after graduation night life â€“ we re not much of a party school  you can find a few parties here and there on weekends but they re usually small parties  most parties take place off campus in the bigger city  dallas or fort worth  students drink alcohol but not usually at the bars or clubs  they hang out at dorms or apartments food at school â€“ we have a cafe place where students on a meal plan can get a variety of meals for each meal of the day  we have some restaurants choices on campus such as  subway  chick fil a  pizza hut and panda express  we have a salad bar and sushi choices  we also have a little student market that has some deli choices and microwaveable foods  we have a good variety to choose from  the price is a little high though guys are awkward â€“ you ll barely notice anyone talking to you if you are not in the greek society i really like how easy and quickly they responded with the financial aid  unt took forever to reply back and they did not even give me enough money so my family won t be in debt i commute â€“ it would be great if uta makes some more available parking lots because every semester the student population increases  you don t really need a car to get around campus because of the buses the computers at uta work great  i ve never had one crash on me and they also have macs provided on campus  i appreciate how they have adobe programs provided on computers that aren t in the classroom because it would suck if i had to wait for classes to be finish to use the computers  i also appreciate that they have good ink in the printers because at home sometimes my printer does not print good quality  i can always rely on uta s systems to help me get the job done without having to worry about mistakes money money money  the financial aid process was great  no major setbacks or anything onine is schooling is looking up  i was completely over joyed when i seen that uta offered the online bsn in nursing  i have been looking for a school that offered this type of program for years  so when i finally came across this on the uta s website i was so thankful  uta finally put an end to my search  thanks uta mostly standard college classes  some excelthere are lots of officers to speak too  very safegetting my apartment was easy and painlessit s fairly standard  community events and friendswithout a football program  it can be shallow i enjoy the pace  it s a very  upbeat  environmentthere have been multiple assaults last semester but they were all in other parts of campus from my classes uta has an incredible glassblowing program that i feel extremely blessed to be part of    so many talented folks that are eager to help anytime i take advantage of rate my professor to avoid getting bad ones but sometimes i have no control over it and it affects my grade in that class  the class sizes varies from class to class there have been a good deal of incidents of crime on campus but i generally feel safe on campus even though i try to avoid being out by myself after it gets dark vandergriff is the best  the housing process is simple  overall the residence halls are good the athletic facilities are great and i believe the teams are good but school spirit is horrible i m only going to be a sophomore but its been okay  there s a lot of cool things going on during the start of a new school year it typically depends on the major it is a large state school  not small or private i am sure there is crime  but i am unaware so far i am not very familiar with greek life on campus uta does not have many competitive school teams once admitted everyone was helpful i have a job on campus and i love working there  the people are so helpful and kind the weather in texas is very unpredictable but uta does a good job of helping their students during these crazy days i didnt get any scholarships and i dont qualify for work study so i have to take out loans and work while in school mc donalds by the campus gives a student discount and wing stop does also need sme work â€“ need more for students that is not based on sat scores and need some for continuing studentsapply early for housing â€“ because it is a commuter campus  there are not a lot of openings for dorms  there is no differentiation between freshman dorms and upperclassmen dorms  so get your application in early so you can get the dorm you want  there is a wide range of quality of dorms  with the   newer dorms   k c  hall and arlington hall  being very nice and the rest of the older dorms rather dumpy  brazos and trinity   there is relatively no middle ground  except one  lipscomb  that is older but still acceptable music department â€“ i choose uta because of the influence of the violin professor  from whom i had been taking lessons throughout high school  the rest of the professors in the music department are all very friendly and know all the students in the program because it is a small community  despite its compact size  the program is flourishing with talented teachers and students  i have learned a ton over my three semesters and do not mind repeating professors because they are all great teachers athletic centers â€“ the athlectic centers are excellent  the workout facility and the basketball courts are the best  they have alot of activities that you can be involved in and even more for your own personal training regime  the places to just chill out with friends and relax after classes are awesome   so many choices of things to do from studying to relaxing makes college life better uta is very diverse with a pretty even mixture of white asian indian  and latino races could be better â€“ i would like to see a better faculty staff especially at the financial aid desk  bus routes take too long  they need more buses for more people crimes happen sporadically â€“ the security at my school do a good job of keeping crime rates low the university of texas at arlington is well known for its openness to admissions  however  with requirements  the university s library is open      especially during mid terms and finals weeks  ut arlington is less strict on the freedoms that every student desire  the school has a wide variety of availabilities in accessing computers  lounges  cafes  gyms  and food courts crimes on campus â€“ the university of texas at arlington is an extremely large campus  it would be difficult to spot any drug activity amongst students or non students on campus  however  the university does have a good security force in which there are several security personnel driving in and around campus  i personally have not heard of any drug related incidents apart from the workload and studying for tests  the nightlife at the university of texas at arlington is terrific  however  most of these events include some sort of payment to enter  it is better to have parties and hangouts in a student s own dorm room uta is located in downtown arlington and so there are many businesses around  there are plenty of restaurants  some old and some new  but they are convenient to get to  i ve only heard of a few student discounts at some places though  the variety is good  but its mostly fast food  when i want to get something fast i either go to chipotle or bethany  an asian restaurant thus far  i have received a federal aid from applying fafsa though it does not cover the extra costs for attending a semester at ut arlington  some of the federal aid is loan and it is both subsidized and unsubsidized  i currently struggle trying to earn a scholarship because i have to pay an out of state tuition  the books are very expensive  these are extra costs that are considered when i pay for the uta semester tuition  i am still searching and applying for scholarships and hoping that i will earn some to be able to afford the extra costs of attending ut arlington i live at an apartment in a different city  so i have to commute through the freeway      as for apartments near ut arlington  i ve been to some of them  and it is really comforting  some of the housing are available before a semester begins because there are a lot of students who need housing as close to campus as possible  there s an apartment called centennial court  and it has modern style interior designs and furniture  it has lots of parking space  a gym  and it is close to campus  another one is called maverick place or  uta student housing   it has the same aspects  however  it is a large cubic building with an open door swimming pool in the center  every apartment near uta has a local police car that checks the area  overall  i would definitely recommend students to come in one of the uta s off campus housing the public computers at ut arlington library is very helpful to students with no computers in their nearby apartment or dorm rooms  computers at the ut arlington library have two central areas where students can print out their papers  the downside of having central printers is that during finals or midterms  they may get very crowded  during the day  practically all of the computers are being used  and some students would have to stand around and race each other for a seat  i have seen some students who carry their own laptops to school and sit on couches in study lounges  these students are only those who can actually afford a personal laptop  the computers at ut arlington are somewhat insecure and lack the student priority usage  non students can freely enter the library and use a computer with a guest pass  certain computers have broken or damage keyboards and mouses that need to be fixed  an example is that the keyboard elevator underneath the keyboard on some computers have been broken  for some students  this makes typing an essay very uncomfortable because the keyboard does not angle up with student s hands well  there have been several reports with problems on wireless access from using a laptop  overall  i would still recommend students to use ut arlington library computers because they solve the students need for computersgreeks are just   there â€“ if you re the type to party then fine  unless you re the type that likes to work hard then don t be involved with one the outdoors is great  but the thing is that there are lots of people walking around if you plan to do something outside everybody loves everybody â€“ there is no one in sight who is not friendly  all seems like close friends or family which is nice no car â€“ i don t have a car but getting a ride from someone and seeing them take almost    minutes to park is really annoying  it defeated the purpose of getting a ride in the first place friendly people â€“ you see all types of people here and most are really friendly and nice  from your back home countryback kids to the surbanites  uta has a good mix of everything expensive and unhealthy â€“ we have a plaza where we have subway  panda express  sushi  pizza hut  and chick fil a  we don t really have healthy options which isn t good  also the cafe food is even worse and without a meal plan you can t get in most events are inside so as long as your okay to walk in the rain  your experience at the event won t be too much ruined arlington  tx â€“ there ae many things to do in arlington if you make the best of what you have  the rangers and cowbows stadium are not far from the university  six flags an hurricane harbor are also near along with the parks mall  cooper st  is overflowing with different restaurants and shopping centers  as for cultural activities unless their on the campus there isnt much to do  i would feel pretty safe walking on the street by myself if i was near the campus because the unitversity has its own police  the university also offers the mavericks ativites center on campus that anybody can come to  but is free for students  the city doesnt really too much acknowledge the school or support it s activities that i have seen business management â€“ there is a greek fraturnity on campus that is especially for the businees major  they have study sessions and attend multiple netwoeking events  the teachers are also nice so far they aren t as bad as expected if you actually attend class regularly  exams are pretty easy if you put in the require studying time  tutors are readily available and there are dozens of different study groups that would be willing to help  the college of business also has workrooms where students can go to get help  professors are easy to talk to and welcome you to get help during their work hours the cost of some things are too high for most students that aren t working or funded with helpful payment options  although there are some good deals that you can get just have roomates in mind social atmosphere â€“ the greeks leave a great atmosphere with how social they are  most of them are usually welcoming and helpful  they also throw great parties my application and registration process was easy with the help of advisors  they are will to take the time to help you understand all that is needed to be successful not party central â€“ public transportation is non existent in this city  so party animals will have to drive themselves or pay for a cab  after dark around here there s not a lot within even a    minute drive  nestled between dallas and fort worth  there are bar club things to do  but not nearby  and not cheap could be worse â€“ within a    minute walk of any edge of campus one can find two places serving alcohol  many of the usual fast food suspects  and also original  unique little places one will only find here  several  ethnic  options are around  as well  for the large international student population and the rest of us who like hummus  curry  etc so far  so lucky â€“ the campus is so  quiet  regarding crime and such it seems hard to imagine trouble  and the police and security services seem professional enough  but the place is wide open for any sort of mischief and seems to be riding on the fact that no one has wanted to try anything     yet  if someone wanted to  they could cause a lot of grief on this campus  and that s sad because it s a nice place  lighting after dark is pitiful  there are working  easy to see call boxes all over campus  but that only helps if you can get to one in the dark moderately strict â€“ discipline issues don t seem to even crop up much  the campus can get loud from organized activities like step demonstrations and the like  but the student population seems to be mature  overall  and here to get a degree  not to party or cause trouble what there is is hidden â€“ i don t do it  but i also never see it or hear about it  even the usual reports and rumors about drug or alcohol related incidents are almost non existent  even the greek world seems to go easy on it getting scarce â€“ used to be plentiful access to both macs and pcs  but the largest computer lab on campus was moved to another building and the number of pcs cut in half and the macs completely discontinued  there are several places to go for pc use on campus  but when you need to find something or print something in a hurry you can be in trouble  there s a decent  but small digital media center in the basement of the central library for gimongous color prints and such  but likely to be a line not bad â€“ in summer there s only one route  free  thought    two buses orbit the campus so each stop gets hit every    minutes      minute round trip on one bus  spring and fall there s a second route  also free  that links to the first and take students to more restaurants  a walgreens  etc  on weekends there are buses to and from a walmart in the morning  and to a large local mall in the afternoon each trip costing    one way  the city itself is infamous for being the largest in the us with no public transportation  so the school does what it can to help out not enough â€“ i found a cheap place  bills paid  across the street from campus before they tore down hundreds of units on campus  there are new apartments built near campus but i haven t visited them  they look nice  but also look expensive  on campus apartments are small  but not cheap  some have wifi  maybe all  the dorms look nice in photos but i m not a dormitory type guy  half of the nearest apartments now are either very old and run down  or expensive  even both not bad â€“ the cafeteria is better than average institutional menu with vegetarian options and reasonable execution  any place like it will  miss  now and then  but overall i like my meal plan  there are also options on campus for starbucks  panda express  pizza hut  subway  chic fil a and even sushi  the small convenience store is also handy for scantrons  toiletries  soft drinks and snacks intramurals sports â€“ the intramural sports are big on campus  the are a fun way to get together and have fun with friends  even if your team doesn t win you have fun playing a game you like to play  i recently hurt my foot so i haven t been able to eplay any intramural sports  the funnest intramural sport is playing football in the mud here in arlington  most of the advisors are good  some advise you on what they would do  so you could just ignore them  the people here are very nice and offer a lot of help  you really do have to put a lot of effort into your work because if you don t  you will fail   college is nothing like high school i have been living in texas my whole life so i m pretty use to the weather changing  if you are not use to the weather changing constantly  then you would not want to go to a school in texas period  the weather is always changing and it s either really hot or really cold  some people get sick when the weather changes so if you re one of those people  i don t recommend coming to texas there is a great diversity of all different races ethnicies   uta does not discriminate against people s religion or their background   uta is an open school and accepts all kinds of people its a very friendly area  you can get along with just about anybody on campus and their are a variety of different kinds of people their  teachers are always willing to help when you need it high school â€“ i am not currently in a universtity  i am only taking a few dual credit classes their  so i dnt live on campus this is not your preppy party school â€“ while uta is not a prestigious private school  it is also not a party school  you don t really see the typical  frat boys  and  sorority girls  around campus  everyone dresses normally  not too fancy  you don t feel self conscious walking around campus in sweat pants if that s the mood you re in for whatever you re in the mood for  working out  playing a pick up game of basketball  swimming  studying  eating   there s a great place to do it  the maverick activities center is huge  there s a quite a few choices to get food  the library is very nice  not too quiet  but there is a silent floor if you like to study in silence   all of the dorm buildings have computer labs and study spaces  my main concern is that the food places are basically all in one building  except for one place  einsteins bagels is on the other side of campus   so if most of your classes are on the other side of campus  you have to eat at einstein s or not eat at all a city of so much to do  yet so little to do â€“ arlington has quite a few big things  the cowboy stadium  the texas rangers  stadium  six flags  hurricane harbor   but all of those things cost a lot of money  there a few things for poor college students to do there s a mall nearby  and a nice shopping center called the highlands with lots of restaurants  it s also convenient that fort worth is so close as fort worth has a lot of things to offer uta being in texas  the weather can get very tough to deal with  it gets extremely hot during the summer months the greek life at uta is great  everyone is very open and friendly  i have plenty of friends that are in greek life  and have been awsome  the parties they throw are good fun and they dont mind if you arent in the club the central library â€“ the library is a great place to study and take time off between classes  the resources available are great  and the fact that it is open      is very helpful for studying late night most diverse â€“ one thing that stands out at ut arlington is the diversity   uta is the most diverse school in the ut system and in the metroplex   because of this  the school is constantly celebrating its diversity and recognizing all of the students ethnic backgrounds there are always a number of activities going on campus   there is a billiards club and bowling alley in the university center   there are several movies showing on campus every week   transportation is available to and from local shopping and malls   the campus is also in close proximity to local pubs and restaurants not safe â€“ i feel that the campus is not safe   in the last year there have been numerous assaults and muggings in which university students were victims and the suspects are not students at ut arlington   campus police have made efforts to warn students to be aware of their surroundings and have made themselves available as escorts to students and faculty but there still appears to be crime on campus there are many choices â€“ there are plenty of choices on what to eat at the uc and that s about it  the only problem i have with that is that you have to walk such a long distance just to eat the school spirit isn t to great but their are some fans and supporters  our teams are pretty good especially the volleyball girls and baseball teams off campus housing around uta is good  prices are convinient if you have a roomate  safety is really good we have stations that with a press of a button we get help from the uta police  very helpful  pros of off campus housing is the price  it is cheaper and you have your own kitchen to cook your meals  another pro is that you dont have to pay for parking and waist gas money  a con is you dont get the dorm life experience i think around campus there are good dinning options  there is a mall where food can be found  a chipotle  taco bell  fuzzy tacos  chinese food  and kfc  at affordable prics  their are also student discounts in some of the restaurants and a good place to check out is fuzzy tacos  delicious the social life â€“ the social life at this school is very good  the students are very proud of who they are and they have to much maverick spirit  also  there are parties very often in the library there are plenty of computers for the students to use  but there are many students and they have to wait in the line in order to get the work done  the wireless connections are usually good in the library there are plenty of computers for the students to use  but there are many students and they have to wait in the line in order to get the work done  the wireless connections are usually good the parking spaces are very unusual to find  the students have to wait in the line for someone to pull out in order to park  there are some students that open the windows and ask other students and people if they are leaving so that they can follow them  also  most of the parking spots are for students living in the campus  the cost for the regual daily parking is    per hour not on campus â€“ at least drug use is not too common on campus   no one is going around offering drugs for sale   if you find local friends though   you could have outlets to start drinking and smoking fairly quickly   you can do or abstain from whatever you want here   b for options great freshman workload â€“ the core curriculum is fair and appreciated   the numerous grad students teaching first year english are really into their jobs and want you to do well   as a student who wasn t expecting much from the local college  i was blown away by its expectations of students to work hard and think critically only on campus â€“ arlington is the largest city without public transportation   however  there are consistent busses on campus and you can call a police escort at night to take you to your car dorm if you re worried there s a huge amount of diversity on the campus   everyone s also very accepting of different ideas for the most part and doesn t have to keep a guard   other than my roommate who introduces himself as an atheist and the warming  you re not going to judge me are you    rnin one of my classes  there was a coptic believing egyptian and a russian   both moved to america when they were twelve rninteresting people and views are everywhere if you park in the wrong place or have your permit on the wrong side of the windshield   you will get a ticket   other than that  i haven t seen any police giving anyone a hard time or bustin  parties   they re very helpful actually   just anal about parking many options â€“ dfw has basically the best texas sports teams  cowboys  rangers  mavericks  and stars   not into sports   dallas is filled with clubs and fort worth has the lively  western billy bob s club   not into clubs   well you ll find something here   suburbs like arlington have the best prices and numerous job options for college students excellent friends â€“ i met alot of awesome friends at ut arlington  mainly due to their world class activity center the drug scene is almost nonexistant  i have never been pressured to use drugs university of texas at arlinton is a school where everyone s not afriad to come together and help each other  the professors help you in every way that they can before during and after class  the work isnt are people because it will be presnted in ways that you would understand  there are many popular areas that student hang out a like the libary and the student loungeextreme heat   flood â€“ our temp was over     and breaking records at the beginning of the school yr and then we had storms from the hurricane that reached us that flooded a couple of bldgs  on average the weather is not that bad though do not really know much about police policy â€“ i really have not experienced  seen  or heard much about police policy but i am sure if they saw someone drinking or doing drugs they would be in trouble no football team â€“ no football but i am in marching band and we march at contests and other team games  we also have good basketball and other sports but i know a lot of people miss having a football team even though i do not well i live in some apratments near campus so i have my car parked there and just walk to class but all my commuting friends complain that it takes them around    mins to find a spot on campus students on campus â€“ well  of course everywhere you go you know where you can find most of the attractive females and males  those who are involved in greek life rnoverall  i would say there aren t that many attractive guys  some of the girls are decent  and then of course there is that one rare attractive down to earth guy in your class  technical assistance â€“ the university of texas at arlington has many computers around campus  whether in individual colleges or in the main library  they recently got new macs  the internet connection is fast and there are many printers in   of the floors in the library as well as in the individual colleges around campus  basically if a student is in need of a computer  they are easliy assesable nothing major or special that i can even call out cowboys stadium here  the new huge dallas cowboys stadium is here  along with the texas rangers baseball team  with them both being less than a   minute drive from campus  the city has six flags  hurricane harbor  and so much more because it is very urban and in the city new gym     great  newly renovated gym student activities center is great  very modern and state of the art  can do homework by the computers or workout the university offer at no cost to the students free rides to and from classes living on campus â€“ i love my dorm and my room mates   the dorm is centrally located in respect to my classesmaverick place â€“ this is the best rated off campus housing developement  and for good reason  this place is built with the student s wants and needs in mind  it s close to the ut arlington campus  it is close to plenty of shopping areas and doctor s offices  and the cost for rooms and amenities is relatively low  it is like a home away from home uta has a  good quality of food but sometimes the prices are expensive security on campus â€“ the university of texas at arlington has one of the best security   we have officer and staff securing the campus the parking lots have the best officer securing our vehicles  i feel very secure when i am on campus looks good â€“ the dorms look good but i live in the on campus apartments  which are not bad  but parking a big problem around tcc â€“ although the prices of the restaurants around campus are not ideal  there is a small variety of options  chapps  firehouse subs  and oc burgers are in the immediate vicinity and are not bad choices  a few minutes away you can find many delicious restaurants such as chilis  tgif  carabbas  etc  i like the school environment  though there s alot of people smoking in which i dislike  i really want to go to another college in which would be suitable for me very diverse â€“ this is a pretty diverse campus  there are students from all backgrounds  minorities combined make up more than half of the student population this is a pretty diverse campus  there are students from all backgrounds  minorities combined make up more than half of the student population greek row is nice â€“ greek row has many beautiful sorority and fraternity housing options  and everyone is definitely aware when it is greek rush week on campus  however  apart from that  greek life has little presence in day to day campus activities no football team  we have an awesome  multi million dollar gym  and great participation in intramural sports  but there is no football team  this causes a lower than normal level of school spirit  students even walk around campus wearing other school s t shirts  caps  etc  however  we have a very recognized wheelchair basketball team  great handicapped sports program there is quite a bit of racial diversity   with a large portion of students consisting of those of asian and indian descent  students come from a wide background of religions and beliefs  as well as economic backgrounds uta has a great library that is   stories  there is a lot of room and you can always find a place to study even during finals week  uta also has the maverick activities center aka the mac  the mac offers a gym  an auditorium  a place to eat  pools  exercise classes  a computer lab  a place to study   and a place to lounge around and maybe play some pool basically safe â€“ there are some incidents of crime but not too often  uta does send out a message to all the students about the crime and how to avoid it happening to you prof know their stuff â€“ the professors at uta in the music department know what they are talking about  they are knowledgeable about their subject and it makes you feel that you are getting the most out of your classes omg  parking is so limited  prepare to walk alot  right now with construction is going on  even more parking limitations  parking permits are high  over     per year   if you don t have a permit  be prepared to pay the fine  it s a commuter school so people drive i m not much of a party girl  i m clueless about what goes on regarding the party scene  but i do know that underage drinking is present  the responsible adults who work for the school and report such behavior just turn the other way and pretend nothing happened  there are some clubs  transportation  well better get to know a friend who has a car  public transportation is virtuall nonexistent study areas â€“ the library has a wonderful environment to study with two quiet areas  there is also another area at the university center to study with computers and in the weekend it closes later than the library  the couches makes it comfortable too the surrounding town is the best part about uta   arlington has the highest fast food per capita in the nation  which can either be a good thing or a bad thing   being so close to the metroplex  everything is within reach  the only real problem is  how will you choose good but not many options â€“ i love the food on campus   however  there isn t enough to chose from   after a year of nothing but on campus food it starts to get really boring   west of cooper there isn t any food really   use the uc and i suggest the sushi   food in the cafe is       all you can eat which is expensive for college students so i suggest only eating there if you have a meal plan easy going â€“ the city is well located between dallas and fort worth and close to major airports  dfw and dallas love field   museums and amusement parks as well as stadiums for nfl  mlb  nhl  mls  and nba games are within the metroplex area  several other institutions of high education are well within the area  therefore giving access to some of the most advanced knowledge and technology in the world for education and career purposes welcoming second home â€“ uta alumni welcome and are very helpful to incoming students  there are plenty of student organizations where students may ask for tutoring or simply enjoy their common interests with others while having free food  there are plenty of activities where students get the opportunity to meet and make new friends  professors encourage attendance but are not strict about it  professors announce study groups and encourage them there are alot of dangerous neighborhoods but a few nicer places further away from campus  traffic tends to get pretty severethere is no such thing â€“ not only is there no public transportation at all  but to qualify earlier questions  there are exactly    seven  places to eat not so nearby  and there are   bars in town the rest requre a     fourty five minute tour to downtown dallas or fort worth  sorry to mix subjects on you strong athletic department  there is a great athletic life  that i m not part of  but i can see that it is outragously popular   the fans both outside our school and from within love our teams not enough where they need them  they might have one on every administrators desk but they dont have them in the labs and we would have to leave a lab to seek out a pc room to complete an assignment seeking computers   we had a teacher tell us  bring your laptops if you ve got em  that leaves potentially a large part of the lab hanging in the wind parking sticker cost too much and the availability of parking is ok but could build more places for students to park instead of faculty upperclassmen dorms â€“ the dorms at univeristy of texas at arlington are in very good condition and are continuing to build brand new ones very hot â€“ uta is subject to texas weather    extremely hot in the summer  humid  mild in the winter and the majority of spring thoughdrugs are in every college â€“ yes  drugs  mostly marijuana  are at uta   but  i m willing to bet you can get drugs at     of all colleges and universities in the u s   it basically depends how hard you look  who you hang out with clubs east and west â€“ the university of texas at arlington is sandwiched between dallas and fort worth  dfw    there are several bars in arlington  but for clubs you ll want to go    minutes or so to dallas in the east  or    minutes to fort worth in the west anything you want â€“ at uta i ve noticed looks and dress are not of great importance  most kids are either trying to finish a degree or are commuter students  people walk around in mostly athletic wear and a lot of people ride bikes  the nightlife here isn t as huge as most of the texas schools  so it s mostly the fraternity life that focuses on social life as a white female  i m a major minority at this school  there is every race and religion around at this school so everyone must walk on egg shells so as to not hurt anyone s feelings  there are even certain times of the week where a certain race will meet up and hang out on campus  which i find a little odd i came to uta after being at utsa for two years to pursue a nursing degree like my mother  through the great advisors to helpful faculty i have finally found my place on campus as a lifeguard  swim instructor  and spanish and education major  the campus is beautiful and i like the smallness of some classes mixed with other larger classes  there is virtually tons of opportunities for everyone at this school  any major  and degree  and almost any type of person professor imaginable athletic center â€“ the gyms and clubs offered at uta are really good  there are different facilities for swimming  basketball tennis weights clubs include martial arts of all kind love it  i have really enjoyed my time at uta  it was a significant improvement from when i was first in undergrad  back in the early      s campus police on top of things  the campus police are well empowered and on top of things  i always felt safe  i especially like the disclosure aspect of their policies  if an incident occurs that is of snificant importance to the studunts staff  a campus wide email goes out right away  advising everyone of the event and what steps have been taken few and far between â€“ there are a few buses that drive around campus during the weekdays  and there is one shuttle that goes to a grocery and to a mall on the weekend  but other than that  there is nothing  arlington is the largest city in the us without public transportation  it is hard to get around without a vehicle  so i suggest students make friends fast depravity within reach â€“ the housing is minimal  but it is very nice and affordable  however  dues are outrageous  and their activities often lack discretion  excessive drinking is all but advocated  and it is central to most of the organizations  weekend activities  however  they do occasionally volunteer and and participate in dry activities such as intramural sports and campus wide events  rnthe administration is not strict enough on these organizations  and i encourage all students i meet to join a professional greek organization rather than the drama and financial burden of social greeks functional but uninviting â€“ it serves its purpose  but it is really expensive for what it entails  especially since the most expensive dorms require that you purchase one  since arlington has no public transportation and there are no groceries in walking distance  pretty much any freshman without a car needs one  convenient for dining services  also  if you eat the food as often as the meal plan suggests  i can pretty much guarantee you the  freshman     and then some understanding for commuter students â€“ while the administration appears to prefer students who dorm  the professors and other students are very understanding of commuter students  this was very important to me because i teach piano out of my home and wanted to be able to continue this without feeling like an outsider for not dorming  one day the school even had free coffee and donuts for the commuter students decreased computer labs cause frustration â€“ uta recently closed the main computer lab  ransom hall  to open a freshman advising center  there are now more computers available in the university center  but it is difficult to study there because of the social atmosphere  it is almost impossible to find an open computer in the libraries during mid terms and finals uta has a good wifi and there are restaurants with free wifi so bring your own laptop you will find it here  apartment everywhere   old  new  good  bad  cheap  expensive   all that you can imagine   something for everybody why arlington  arlington is an entertainment capital  the uta mavericks are just    to    minutes away from all sorts of entertainment opportunities  downtown arlington offers is filled with art and music   maybe you want action   try six flags over texas or hurricane harbor   sports fans  how about the rangers ballpark or the dallas cowboy stadium   lots of student discounts   don t forget to give back   mission arlington provides many levels of service opportunities it s just like it s own town â€“ the police force is pretty lenient on what goes on around campus  the only thing you really have to look for is parking tickets  they are definately a bunch of meter maids right down the street from the campus is the parks mall  it has everything to eat from vegan to fried chicken and from the dollar menu to the pull out your plastic  i love the convenience of having just about anything to eat right down the road there are many parties to go to rather than anything else so if you are looking for some fun than parties are the thing to do apartments off campus is a great and easier way to live while in school  actually it is a better idea to live in a apartment close to the campus than to live on campus because it is cheaper and not as many rules middle of the day is crowed â€“ at times like around   to    o clock all the computers are taken  if anyone needs a computer then he or she needs come in early to do so or wait until   or   o clock to have one open for use  the printers are some times working fine then other times not at all  you will never know if they will be working when you need them to they are the hype of the school â€“ greek life is there to show how they live and act  they are usually the main attractions for the on campus parties  i would like to join because i see is as a opportunity to meet and greet new people easy travel â€“ after viewing the campus i saw that it is easy to get around and if there were any location questions the students on campus are more than will to show and or direct you  i like to know that there are people who will help others to make their destinations there is no public transportation system and no off campus parking i don t know much about the drug scene  it is not prevalent  so one would have to search it out dfw area â€“ dallas and fort worth provide a wide variety of activities  from the symphony to a large number of bars and night clubs beautiful campus  dumb management â€“ it is an awesome place  very beautiful campus  students rock     classes are ok  management is not great  socially active  lots of events  especially in fall  staying on campus is enjoyable  and convenient  no smoking or drinking on campus  which is fine  no public transportation options   boo girls are awesome  a lot of girls jog  walk around the campus  use the activities center  and keep fit and healthy  most look intelligent  not just pretty  some are especially active on campus dance team  drill  student groups  clubs etc  great diversity of nationalities and races adds quality to the campus    academic and non academic     a few are outright awesome i received a pretty good scholarship from uta  it was about       a semester  which is pretty good  i did not have any problems with forms  but i wish i did get more money great  with exceptions â€“ i have had a great experience at uta so far  there are some brilliant professors i have had the pleasure to work with  and there are wonderful students who are active in club activities  however  i am less than displeased about the couple of substandard professors i have had the misfortune of working with in the recent spring semester  it is unacceptable  in such an institution that is supposedly dedicated to higher education  also  the administration  whether it be tech support  or some other department or other  is not very helpful  they are polite  but delightfully unhelpful in answering my questions  they need to change this  replaced the bad professors with better ones  and have a more helpful staff  too bad the few substandard professors i had come into contact with are on tenure and can t be removed  it is unfortunate that we are being ripped off in this manner  i will make the most of the rest of my experience and take care not to enroll in the classes where the professor has less than positive reviews finding parking is already hard enough without having to worry about getting parking tickets for random offenses  i have gotten a ticket for being a little over the line  if you take a walk through the parking lots  you will see university police keenly patrolling the area and putting ticket after ticket on students  cars  it seems as though the university is intent upon sucking the money out of us  whether it be in tuition fees or parking tickets and fines  that sounds bitter  i know  but it is true and it is unfair  i understand parking safely is important  but to deliberately look for minor offenses and issuing fines of     or     dollars is an abuse i feel pretty safe on campus at ut arlington  but we have been getting a lot of crime bulletins  so it s kind of scary  but i feel pretty secure  i was kicked out of the library at   am one day  just because i had dozed off after my all nighter  that made me feel pretty insecure about my safety  and also a little angry at the library administration  all the other buildings were closed  so i couldn t even wait outside my classroom for my morning class to start  i wandered around until they opened the buildings at around   am  rnbesides that nasty event  nothing dangerous has happened to me at uta advisors are extremely knowledgable and helpful â€“ the college nursing advisors are extremely helpful in picking courses and deciding which route one should take in the reaching goals quickly and efficiently   they are to help with anything you need to know in your college experience need a football â€“ i would say we are popular in terms of wheelchair basketball  everything else is average  no football team   zero school spirit  basketball is probably the hottest thing the best thing about this campus is the diversity  there are different kinds of people from different countries and students coming from a wide variety of demographics connection cafe the plaza â€“ the plaza offers fast food restaurants like subway  pizza hut  chickfil a  and a decent sushi place  rnthe connection cafe quickly gets old  they always have the deli section  pizza  cheeseburgers  the also have a vegan section  then there are two sections that changes  one of them is called real food on campus  it s       chance you ll like it  the other section either serves pasta or burrito nacho fajita place  blue bell ice cream is always available  there s also a desert area that always has cookies  and there is also a salad bar  next to it  the area offers some random and special stuff that could be dessert or main course  you can use your dining dollars at the market  but it s pricey  also  einstein bros is amazing  starbucks and a smoothie milkshake place is there also  meal plans are expensive and too much there s no place like texas â€“ although texas weather is usually very unpredictable  it usually never affects my experience on campus   rarely does the campus close for a snow day  in that event  such time is a bonus for studying   although it is usually extremely hot  walking to campus is pleasurable as there is plenty of shade and pleasant scenery  when it rains  there are plenty of coverings so that hardly gets in the way either minimal drug usage â€“ honestly  i have not noticed drug usage what so ever on campus   although i do not live on campus  i would assume that such usage would be visable   in simply overhearing conversations  alcohol usage is present  but simply in the event of social gatherings fast food options â€“ unless you intend on driving a few miles down the highway  the options around the campus are mostly fast food chains   inexpensive  yes   healthy  absolutley not  they don t offer student discounts off hand  they might if such discounts were requested  the best places to go  in my opinion  are smoothie king  ghengi s grill  and subway   other than those options  you are looking primarily at wendy s or mcdonalds greek life and the bsm are the best school activities  fraternities and sororities are always up to something fun  interesting and new  the bsm is a place for students to worship god we have jocks â€“ sports at university of texas at arlington vary from basketball to baseball  we have intensive training and workout for the jocks  the turnout of every game is satisfactory very simple â€“ they distribute financial aid directly to your student account so you don t have to worry about anything parking is okay  i would go      mins early  just in case though because sometimes parking is a pain to look for  i believe they are building another parking lot so there should be less problems now bring a car â€“ the campus is pretty nice but if you don t have a car then you have nothing to do in your free time other than stay on campus  bring your car otherwise you are going to be relying on other people for everything campus and off campus apartments â€“ the housing at this campus is just wonderful  whether you are on or off campus  you feel right at home  i love it  walking is the quickest and easiest way to get around school  sometimes even riding a bike helps  but dont too many people do that  either way the exercize is good for you   a great town â€“ coming from a small town and going to arlington was the best decision i ve ever made  there is so much to do  the atmosphere is totally different here than my hometown  they have many off campus apartments so there s a lot to choose from and also six flags is next door  who couldn t love that    the uta computer labs have been very helpful to me  i am currently in need for my own personal laptop  but the computer labs have been a good alternative  the computer labs in my dorm allowed me to print as much as i needed as long as i provided my own paper  the      that is automatically loaded on our mavid is helpful when i have to print documents in the computer labs around campus  the only complaint i have is when the software was  being updated this past semester  for about a week of two we were unable to print in the computer labs  but besides that i think that the computer labs on campus are extremely helpful and convenient we are all the same â€“ being hispanic  i found uta a very nice place   i don t feel any discrimination due to religion  ethnic  political background  others   the process is the same for all   no difference   of course  it is a big college  hence  a lot of  road blocks  but nothing to do with the above reasons   just regular  public  big  college getting to eat when you remember â€“ there are plenty of places around campus to get late night snacks   i like this college since it is in the middle of the city and everything kind of grew up around the college   if you can t find anything open in side campus you can walk about   minutes and find fast food restaurant that serve until about      am or so the great commons area â€“ enjoy this area  different suppliers  pizza hut  subway  wendys  starbuck coffee  others   in our busy days we can enjoy different kind of food  that is you don t like the uta cafeteria food which i believe it is also good  fresh  and hot   we have a  fun  area that we can play pool and enjoy a free time with my classmates or make new friends   here you will find those friends that got lost  inside the college  at the beginning of the semester and that now you can see their faces  even though they are sometime your roomates   kind of funny but real  appropriately strict â€“ the residence halls are very strict in terms of underage drinking and drug use  if you have any sort of conscience  though  you ll understand that this is a good thing  the ra s and residence administration crack down on these things for a reason   drugs and underage drinking have no place in education  it doesn t help the students  and it doesn t help the university s reputation rnrnas for parking  the campus police services are out patrolling each parking lot almost every day and will ticket anyone without a parking sticker for          over half the cost of the parking sticker  so get one  or face a hefty fine every day  the upside  you never have to register your license plate s  with the university  so they never can connect your name with your car s   therefore  they can cite your car     times but cannot make you pay the fine because they don t actually know the owner  you have to go to the campus police department with the ticket and fine  it s somewhat laughable  they also threaten to tow after the third citation  but that also never happens rnrnalso  while there are rules that dictate smokers should stand x feet from the building when lighting up  most students do not abide because the social hotspot corners and sitting areas are inside that range  this rule is never enforced  you can more or less smoke wherever you please  except indoors of course rnrnall in all  as a resident or commuter  restrictions for students are appropriate  however  opinions might polarize when uta becomes a smoke free campus very soon mostly safe â€“ from my point of view  the safety at uta is about what you expect in an overgrown city where the campus is more like infrastructure than architecture  major roads bisect the campus  high schools and children s parks parallel the grounds  the city simply outgrew itself  however  you will rarely walk from the parking lot to class without seeing a police cruiser or bike cop stroll buy rnrnit does make you feel safer  although  there have been about a half dozen crime reports from the university administration during the last two semesters  these were my first two semesters at uta  and although i have not been victim to any on campus crimes  assault and theft have been among the most popular  so i cannot attest for the severity  i will say that i feel safe   times out of    rnrni have a lot of long days  often working until   or    pm and sometimes later  and parking availability dictates i park almost a mile from the fine arts building where all of my classes are held  so i do think it is important that i feel safe during that obnoxiously long walk rnrnthis might be the only department in which uta takes a hit  police patrol at night seems to be thin   at least from my point of view  i walk the same path every day between fa and the parking lot  so i might just have a limited line of sight on their activity  for the most part  i do feel safe in the lit parking lots and the popular street i take   greek row  the emergency pillars  whatever they are called  that allow you to press a button for help are everywhere  thankfully  do they work  no idea  since about   or   dot my path every day  i sure hope so  from what i ve been told  they are well maintained  especially since there has been a rise in crime on campus and in arlington in general the only major challenges that weather presents are that when it rains ut arlington tends to become a water park  forget walking to class  you could use the sidewalks and grass as a slip  n  slide  most of the time texas weather means sunshine and a cool breeze thats perfect for a pick up game of frizbee in front of the library  on freak ocassions there are snow or ice storms but that is a one way ticket to freedom from class  snow day the nightlife scene is primarily for students older than     although there are quite a few hang outs for the non legal students  some of the most popular parties are held at sherlocks irish pub and j  gilligans bar  alot of departmental clubs and after class parties take place in the highlands where there s black finn bar and the ever popular drink and play place dave and busters  other nighttime activities would be playing a few games of bowling at splitsville or alleycats  other options include the rangers ballgames or catching a cowboys season football game parking is a pain  the parking at ut arlington is rough  even though they added almost     new parking spots to try and keep up with the growing student body  they have shuttles that can take you from the furthest parking to central locations of the main campus but they are scheduled to run by the parking lot stations every fifteen to twenty minutes  there are plans to construct a newer parking garage that would have a higher capacity than the older one that is limited to four levels that requires a special parking pass great education â€“ uta is a great place to attend school on a reasonable budget in addition to setting myself up for success in life  thanks utanot your typical greek lifestyle found here  education based working folk â€“ general older working fold seeking higher education uta  along with  i would conceive  every university  has a strict academic policy   a policy that stringently specifies that academic dishonesty and fabrication  will not be tolerated from my observance  i would have to rate the professors for whom i have taken with a grade of a b    the reason i rate them with b  instead of an a is because i am the type of student who does not really need the help or assitance of his professors and who figures  and solves everything he encounters on his own   not to say that the professors for whom i have taken are not great at what they do  it s only to say that they do the job required of them and nothing more  from my perspective  because i am competent  intelligent  and fully cogent enought to comprehend any and everythiing i encounter independent of my professors campus wide variety â€“ they offer a campus wide variety which has encorpoated the fast food indusrty with the cafateria experience  you can have access to the fast food world if you cannot make it to the cafateria  the down side is that there is not a healthy alternative if you are looking for this choice  the cafateria is the only place where the student has access to the healthy choice game day â€“ game day is what we live for  the atmosphere  the friends  the yelling  etc non existent drug scene â€“ the drug scene at school is non existent  drinking is a tad bit more popular  but it s never really seen out in the open  since big consequences will be dealt with if caught  if there is drinking on campus  it will be very hidden and not a lot of people would openly know about it most of the time  uta throws parties  mainly hosted by greeks at arlington clubs  most of the time they are pretty cool  but it sucks when the club rips the promoters out of the money and the partygoers have to suffer for it  that doesn t happen a lot  but it has a couple of times  all in all  the parties are usually good  the best thing to do is to go to a school party to have the most fun because some house parties aren t worth it arlington highlands â€“ the arlington highlands is a place for college students to hang out during the week  nights  or weekends  it has a variety of places to hang out  eat  and have a good time  a couple of places arlington heights has to offer are dave   busters  splitsville bowling  red robin  improv comedy club  pluckers wing bar  and chuys  the prices are pretty average as any other restaurant its been great so far  love the efficiency  friendly staff  large campus  plenty of activities great diversity  an even mix of folks from all races as someone that lives off campus i enjoy it because i am still close enough to campus that i can enjoy the campus  the cons would be not being able to be on campus all the time and meet new people i would say the one downside of this university is that fact that it is in an area that is not seen as the best area of town  you can hear of shootings and gang things  but i guess that can almost be found in any city  the sad thing is that i do not feel comfortable walking around campus by myself after   o clock there is a vareity of computers on the campus which is nice because no matter what type of computer you are use to using there is a good chance you will find it on campus  i love the speed of the wireless networks on the campus they are some of the best i have ever used i think it s average â€“ i don t know much about other campuses so i think it s pretty average here  but can be boring the campus isn t really designed for bad weather and when it happens it can be hard to get around crowded  but you can work around it â€“ as long as you are willing to get there a little early you can get a descent  if not good parking spot arlington texas â€“ arlington texas is a big town with lots of people  although there isn t much to do  the things that are available to do here are very worthwhile and nationally known  university of texas at arlington is a very great college to attend and if weekend fun is needed you should go to the highlands for food and fun or to the parks mall at arlington  the two places where no matter how much you go you can t seem to get enough of review of facilities â€“ the food in the cafe isn t very good but  the food from the resturant s are good greek life â€“ the greek life at uta is that girls don t talk to other girls unless they are in the greek system  they don t give anyone else the time of day unless it is during rush and being super fake  i think they should be nice and inviting all year round not just for one week and then start acting fake again  i don t understand that one bit registered nurses  rns   regardless of specialty or work setting  treat patients  educate patients and the public about various medical conditions  and provide advice and emotional support to patients  family members  rns record patients  medical histories and symptoms  help perform diagnostic tests and analyze results  operate medical machinery  administer treatment and medications  and help with patient follow up and rehabilitation financial advisors â€“ when i applied for a scholarship i did get it it wasn t so bad concerning the process its just the faxing or the mailing your stuff back to them that took up a bit of time when driving over there there are a lot of parking spots you just have to make sure you park at the right places near your classes i love my school â€“ the price is reasonable  the teachers are great  the students are really nice parties happen but not on campus â€“ not a lot of parties occur on campus  the ones that do are usually wholesome where should i park  there are specific parking lots for students  but the ones closest to the college of business always fill up quickly and campus police is quick to give students parking tickets if their parking permits aren t current lack of support at athletic events â€“ not enough students come out to the athletic sporting events   we have a great tennis and basketball teams but not enough students care to attend the matches games a    hour lab is lacking on campus   the library is only open    hours from sunday through friday at  pm absence policy â€“ uta has an abscence policy  if you miss more than three classes your professor can begin to drop your grade  i love this rule because only the people that care some to class and those that don t care get punished for it the library and library assistants at uta are really great and resourceful  there are several campus activities and generally campus aesthetics are okay but saftey is still a huge problemvery social and plenty to do â€“ throughout the week uta has a variety of events and activites available for students   the people here are generally friendly and welcoming   one of the greatest areas we have is the mavericks activities center  mac    this place offers a variety of excercise equipment  multiple indoor tracks  basketball courts  and much more a variety of options â€“ generally  transportation is readily available around campus   a system called  mav mover  is especially great for late night travel   just call them and they will send someone quickly   there are also buses which make routine rounds around campus  on saturdays  these buses will also transport students to wal mart and the parks at arlington at the price of one dollar the cost is pretty high but its pretty decent livingyou can t really blame the campus for the weather  texas weather has a mind of its  own so it s always nice to carry an umbrella and such  i just wish there were more portals to keep up with the weather everyone is different here  i can walk down and see so many cliques but yet everyone hangs out with everyone i have a job on campus and i love working there  the people are so helpful and kind police are quick to respond on campus  i feel okay walking alone at night i live living on campus  close to all my classes and i don t have to drive all the way back home to allen  people at my dorm are very friendly ans outgoing  the dorm themselves are spacious and not that bad i am not really part of greek life but the people are very nice we have great school spirit  but no football team i had a pretty great experience here in my first semester  the students are very friendly and approachable  the teachers want to help you succeed i ve had experiences with  bad  professors and  good  professors  which is to be expected  however  most professors want students to learn and have a passion for teaching their classes in a way that will help students learn more there have been issues with campus safety in the past year  but i think that the campus policy has been working on enforcing security a bit more to achieve a safer campus  although  the campus focuses a bit more on parking than security at times greek life hosts and participates in a lot of the social events on campus that can be fun there is no football team  which is a downside  but there are a variety of campus sports  such as basketball  volleyball  etc   that make up for the absence of the football team the campus is very diverse  so you are able to meet people of different ethnicity on a daily basis  which is pretty cool and not something that many schools out there have  getting to learn about different cultures while studying is a nice and unique combination  the professors that i ve had are very interested in the subjects that they teach and try to help the criminology and criminal justice department offers several guest speakers and a job fair to help students with job prospects the majority of professors in the criminology and criminal justice department have actually worked in the law enforcement field  and will use examples from their experience to teach their classes  this makes it easier to understand the material  the professors care about their students and want to see them succeed  the only problem is the liberal arts departments are typically overlooked by the university and do not get much attention there have been a lot of robberies in the parking lots  i barely seen any cops patrolling the parking lots especially at night i ve had some really great professors that i ve learned a lot from  and they really cared about our auccessthere are a lot of research opportunities readily available for science majorswe can call the cops if we are scared to walk alone at night  and they will escort usrelatively cheap to join  but they don t have a large presence in our achoolwe have a really cool gym  and swimming pool  there are also a lot of activities available to usi like the diversity of my school  however  professors are usually hit or miss  some professors really care about their students while others only teach because they re given research opportunities there are a few food joints near the school like chipotle and mcdonalds and they re always busy because well it is near a school campus full of hungry people  sometimes  it s nice to just order the food to go then eat on the school s campus no to drugs â€“ drug activity is not a major issue at ut arlington  just depends on the crowd your around and what their intentions are  overall its a casuality to drink the university of texas at arlington offers a nursing program which is excellent for those with the intended major  the professors are hands on with the students life in arlington â€“ arlington is town that is growing everyday with the new mall and different restaurants  the university of arlington offers a excellent business school for those interested in that major  when you visit stop and shop around the highlands mall they try to accommodate everyone at their comfort level but they can not be everywhere all the time i like how you are consistent getting email communication asking about your plans where are you in your goal accomplishments due to the fact i am an online student so campus life is not something i can adequately speak on  but my overall experience has been okay and i m happy i choose uta to attend i feel safe at school but i am not sure that everyone does i stray away from the greek life  i know that it is prominent in my school and the ones who participate seem to enjoy by the athletic department i first think of the gym and it is nice but somewhat packed so i use an external gym the school lacks a little bit of spirit and i think that is based on having no football team  other than that i think that there are very fun and interesting activities that make the school fun  i enjoy that because it helps take the stress load off uta is the  th most diverse school in the nation  everybody is welcome to your social circle  no matter what ethnic background your coming from of course in any campus you go there will be drinking or drugs  its common for young adults to use  so far my experience has been great  my friends request me to drink but never really pressure me super fun  it feels exactly like if i was part of a movie  i never expected to actually be that way  the best thing about it  is that they use the fraternities and sororities as a form of network for future job search  the alumni are very helpful and successful making that transition from  a university to real life that much easier we don t necessarily have a sport that is well known in this school but our activity center is pretty cool  if you are just trying to be fit and go to a gym without having to pay that gym membership fee  then your set  it has a basketball court  a track  weightlifting machines  the whole   yard it s a fun school so far  i am glad i decided to transfer here from my community college  it s very diverse so i have met different people from different ethnic backgrounds  so many activities to chose from  can not wait to join greek life as well i love my professors and there are many student centers with wifi  computers  access to cafes and overall great spaces to study i m happy to be on a campus where i ve interacted with people from all parts of the globe  it s refreshing i don t really associate enough with dorm parties or organizations to know about the personal recreational experiences of other students my department is spanish modern languages so there are a variety of courses but it s not flexible because the courses are only offered once a year or in times that may conflict with my work schedule  the east side of my campus looks like it stayed in the     s but the west side for architecture and the north area for engineering has beautiful up to date buildings  i understand why nursing and engineering are the focus of my campus however i wish course variety flexibility extended to my department more than anything although our school has done a lot to combat this safety issue such as provide free escorts to students who are walking long distances to their vehicles  it still seems as though there are constant armed robberies on campus ground and in surrounding areas  this part of arlington in general unfortunately is known for these kind of crimes  there are a decent amount of police officers but to be quite honest they seem more concerned with parking tickets than actually patrolling the campus for safety  i say this because the alerts we receive regarding assaults or robberies show up in my e mail practically every   to   months my professors in particular have been the most helpful in regards to informing us about what internships we qualify for  however the career services on campus tend to offer more opportunities with the engineering and nursing department more than others i wouldn t know i don t have student housing  i commute to school i m not affiliated with any greek life groups so i can t really say the university of texas is the fifth most diverse university in the nation and that is a great achievement to all of us  the vast mixture of cultures and students bring a new vibrancy to the campus and offers opportunities to make new connections with people of all backgrounds  the campus is a nice size that s not overly huge and is a big commuter school  there are tons of active organizations as well as sororities and fraternities that students can be a part of and we definitely do not condone hazing of any kind  uta also has a health services that assist students with all types of concerns from immunizations to mental health and counseling  and a big plus is the awesome library that has so many resources that can help you with classes  exams  studying  research  etc  i really enjoy attending uta and i hope many others do as well whether they re current or future students i like the diversity on campus  a lot of different cultures and regions are represented  which makes for a better learning environment in my opinion  there is a lot to do in the dallas ft  worth area if you are interested in off campus life and experiencing different cultural things the classes are traditional for those of us that like the classroom scene and the activities that are available are always super fun to do i like the attitude that the campus radiates as it helps make freshmen like myself feel welcome and comfortable and adjust pretty well into the campus life  the only thing i wish would be change is the notice for tuition payments as they can be usually close and dont give you notice until it is very close but other than that it does create a great environment to be studying in great school with fantastic teachers and a beautiful campus  i just wish that the environment was centered more around the students than the research that the school conducts uta has been one of my favorite places  everyone is so friebdly there and the premed program is awesome  nothing to change good campus  great instructors  beautiful campus  i was really nervous because in high school i always heard of professors who didn t cared if you passed or not  but the teachers there proved me wrong ut arlington is great  but it could use a little more improvement   i feel that the staff only care about the money  while it is the students who help each other succeed the university of texas at arlington is a very professional and friendly campus  i wouldn t change a thing about it university of texas at arlington is a fantastic school  its faculty is skilled and helpful  the only complaint i have is that  even though it s a  commuter school   there is insufficient parking on campus a decent sized university but doesn t really have the true college feel  very affordable  campus is small enough that you won t ever have to walk    minutes across campus i really liked my time at uta so far  the music program is fantastic  i learned so much from the interaction from the professors and the small size of the classes  there are some core classes i loved as well outside the music program  very open minded and diverse school  i will say that the amount of core classes one must take for their major is a bit much  but i do get the concept of trying to prepare students to be ready for anything the school itself is fairly nice  i just think they are a lot of talk and little action  they always talk about how great the school is but it just seems average  they don t treat us exceptionally well  or poorly and the academics don t seem to be anything extremely special the environment is great  haven t experienced any trouble  there is a lot of diversity ethnicity and most importantly  great professors smoking and drug use on and around campus is open and evident  the university lacks a variety of affordable meal options  especially for commuter students  everything in the campus bookstore is extremely overpriced  uta charges out of state students over twice as much as in state students for tuition  an online course program is basically nonexistent  the university does little to accommodate the needs of commuter students  politically  the university is very liberal  on the other hand  i would say the academic program is rigorous  and if you know who to ask  you can easily find out which professors are better to take than others  uta does have a few really swell profs  i also found other students to be friendly in general  which is a plus  overall though  i wish uta wasn t such a money drainer in day to day life this school has a lot to offer and they are very good at making everyone feel welcome and comfortable  the only thing i don t like about this school is the parking i like how diverse the campus is and the price of my education  but  everything else is rather lackluster  this is a commuter school and it is obvious  the campus social aspect of college is hurt because of this  the people who attend here keep to themselves and are obsessed  more with their phones than interacting with others  i have never felt more alone whilst being surrounded by thousands of people  the professors are hit or miss and the facilities are okay  overall a  meh  schooli enjoy going to uta  i think it is best to be involved with some kind of organization in order to enjoy the full affects of what uta has to offer  overall  in my experience  it is a great school to transfer to well i m still currently enroll at the university  i love the place i just transfer there this past fall semester  the professors were outstanding  they were a lot of help  also they have great food in campus  there s a buffet and its very cheap which is very beneficial for students who are always brokethis school was the best decision ever  i love uta so much it is very diverse and everyone is so respectful  i love my professors they are all very eager to help when you are facing problems  i wouldn t choose any other school  go mavs i am not exactly involved in many sports however i really enjoyed the vast array of services provided by my school gym i have been blessed in that i have been provided amazing mentors who have given me a great deal of insight over the subjects i have studied as well as provided me great deal of service learning opportunities in order to advance my professional experience there are opportunities for campus and off campus work by word of mouth from professors or organizations greek life plays a moderate role at the university  but is not pushed on students i haven t attended any sporting events for the university  but they consistently notify students of any upcoming events to encourage attendance i have had a good share of bad and good professors  but i ultimately feel that i chose a wonderful school and program  i m happy to become alumni of a school that serves such a vast amount of students the diversity is one of the best things about the campus  it presents opportunities for everyone to find a partner the policies at uta are extremely poor and the punishment process is a total joke that just wastes everyone s time there is a lot of car lot robberies which makes me feel unsafe at night walking to my car the school is very unique with a lot of diverse studentsso far the two years ive attended its been greati dont live on campus but from my friend its pretty okay  sports isnt really talked about at uta  uta is a very diverse school  you will meet so many people i try to avoid these situations by staying in once its really late or having a friend walk me half way to my room the class sizes are exactly what i expected  and the professors are very nice i really like were i stay everything is good  but the only downfall is that the mac is all the way across campus i want to join the nphc and they do not have houses  their houses are all the way in dallas instead of on campus  but i do plan on joining pretty soon i have not been to a basketball game at uta yet but this upcoming year i d plan on going  because i ve heard great things about them it s a great school for me  because there aren t many parties or too much violence  i love this school and i m so glad that i chose it campus crime used to be a bigger issue in past years  however in the time that i have been at ut arlington only   times have i heard of crime happening we may not have a football team but our basketball team is great my overall experience at ut arlington has been wonderful so far  i transferred from texas a m college station and honestly it was the best decision i ve made for my education  if i could go back to senior year in high school i would have gone to ut arlington instead of texas a m  the students are friendly  the school spirit is also present  and this university has had a marching band without a football team for over    years  they are the ut arlington ambassadors everywhere i went i saw a security officer and that would make me feel safe  walking towards my car i will always pass an emergency contact pole and that felt very comforting also my adviser and the career adviser told me they would help me look for a job or internships if i needed help  so that is very comforting to hear overall  my experience was great  sure i was nervous but my semester was great i had good grades and made good friends i did not apply for campus housing but i would like to someday apply when i need to i ve met a friend that is apart of  great sorority and she describes it as an amazing experience  unfortunately  we met after enrollments were done but i would not mind joining a sorority in the future i have seen the athletic facilities but  i still need to find my motivation to join in for a membership and workout i would say that my overall college experience is okay  reasons why would be that i can be pretty shy of a person in new environments and i wont speak much until i feel more comfortable with my surroundings  they have a lot of clubs for students to join and the people are very friendly  the professors were friendly but i didn t feel comfortable asking questions when i didn t understand the topic we were learning if you like powerpoint presentations  you re home it s diverse  in regards to population  but the overall mentality is white washed suburban god fearin texan uta is ut s jealous little brother  the core curriculum faculty is horrible  the upper level courses are bland and are the polar opposite of subversive uta is vet friendly  that was the reason i chose the school professors are great  because its a research school  you ll always learn up to date material and the professors i ve had are always very smart  it s also pretty easy to get involved in research  just ask a professor you like i believe this campus is one of the most diverse in texas  so many religions  races  ethnicities  sexualities  etc  it s easy to find a group you fit with  and even easier to learn more about other groups parking sucks  crime sucks  professors are great  classes are alright  it s small campus wise but classes can be very large  it s easy to get involved if you make an effort and join organizations security is an issue  crime has been awful this semester and i avoid being alone on campus now  as far as sexual assaults  there aren t many i m aware of  it s more stabbings and robberies  also  a cop got shot this year do not live in centenial court   nasty place  my boyfriend stayed there and it was awful  i stayed at campus edge and it is worth the money  clean and nice space  the dorms i ve been in visiting friends weren t the bed  very smallthe mac  which is open to all students  is a great place to find any kind of sport or workout  the huge basketball court is really cool too as the classes get more specific  the class sizes goes down  i find that more helpful for teachers to help students when the topics get more difficult there are more opportunities for business majors but health or science related majors don t have as much opportunities crime has occurred any time of the day  there needs to be constant police patrolsome of them do charity work and i can respect that there were great professors that were passionate about what they taught that overshadowed the less competent teachers  there are lots of extracurricular activities to do when you need a break from studying we don t have a football team  therefore  school spirit is low i think it is moderatei haven t looked into any internshipshave not started yet but have heard it is goodi don t plan to stay at the dormsi haven t looked to much into fraternities but i would like to maybe join onei haven t talked looked too much into that departmenti haven t started the school yet but i plan to attend during the fallsafety on campus is not an issue  security is everywhere and is readily available when in need many companies and employers come to campus to recruit students for the workforce  i would say a degree from uta is very greatly valued professors are always there for the students  courses are very creative and are very fun to explore  most classes are relatively small and are more focused on the individual student everyone on campus is involved in sports  whether it is playing them or cheering them on  everyone is somehow involvedut arlington is a very diverse and very welcoming campus  professors put in the best effort for their students to learn and they provide adequate information when necessary  if i had to go back and look at schools all over again  ut arlington would definitely be on my list health and safety is an important feature of uta  sexual assualt  voilence is taken seriously  similary  the campus has a health centre easily accesible to the students ut arlington graduates have large prospects of job and employment  many graduates go to big companies to work after their degree completion  some get admitted into bigger school for higher education  overall  its just great ut arlington graduates have large prospects of job and employment  many graduates go to big companies to work after their degree completion  some get admitted into bigger school for higher education  overall  its just great it is sometimes really hard to get housing on campus  it is also not so spacious the greek life is overall okay  there are lots of organization on campus representing greek life student usually participate in atheletics  our school has a strong basketball  base ball and a football team  apart from those  there are many atheletics oppurtunity in campus university of texas at arlington is very diverse campus with lots of major you can choose from   the education system is one of best among ut system  with affordable and resonable coa and lots of scholarship oppurtunity  it is easy for many students to afford the college the college of business is commendable it was easy to navigate they made it super easy  i have a counselor that calls every week to discuss class schedulesi haven t had too much experience with the athletics because i am an online studentthere are crime reports that happen around campus  but they usually happen on the outskirts or near very secluded spaces  the police are easy to contact since the school gave its students phone numbers regarding campus safety my classes varied  depending on that type of curriculum that was taught in each class  my language classes were small  and i was able to interact with the teacher well enough  my science based classes were large  so it was hard to interact with the teacher  but as long as i stay focus on the material taught  i m well okay in terms of the curriculum  i was able to learn what is benefited for me for my major  i was able to do well in my classes when i found the time to study  the university of texas at arlington is one of the most diverse universities in the country  so i was able to see individuals from different ethnicities and backgrounds everywhere on campus  since i live off campus  it was very hard for me to find individuals who share my interests to interact with  but there are a lot of organizations on campus that helped me find people to interact with  i would choose this school again if i could do it all over because its tuition rates are lower than any other school in texas and its nursing program is really commendable uta has a multitude of cultures that adds to the richness of the college experience i am a little fearful while walking to my car at night  there have been many reports of robberies in parking lots  students have been held at gunpoint many times  sexual assault has been reported near campus  there are definitely more robberies than assaults at uta  the police are very hard working people who make sure our campus is safe  there is a service they provide to escort those who parked far late at night the career center is very helpful and willing to steer you into the right path  i have a friend who is unsure of her major and needed some assistance  the career center was more than happy to help her and she is in the process of choosing her path uta grew on me  i love being on campus and just studying  the atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing  the professors are passionate about their subjects and always willing to help when there is a misunderstanding  communication is easy and quick  class sizes are huge  the lecture halls are always packed with students  the courses offered are plenty with many time slot options i do not live on campus  but have visited some of the on campus facilities which is how i rated them above greek life students are very active around campus and events they do to better the community  every week there is an event to benefit the community in some way such as bake sales  fundraisers  information booths  etc basketball is one of the most hyped up sport at uta  volleyball would be the next sport with the most attendees and fan support  they are fun events to attend  our athletic facilities are very clean and tidy the university of texas at arlington is considered the fifth most diverse campus in the united states  i chose this college because of the accredited nursing program  they also have other programs such as engineering and business  i feel very comfortable at this campus because ethnically  i am a minority  the students and staff here are very friendly and helpful  the staff goes to work everyday with a smile on their faces uta takes the sciences and math very seriously which i can appreciate  the staff is really helpful in all areas  financial  advising  etc   rnrni basically live in the chemistry clinic created by dr  rogers at uta  it s free and there are chem tutors who know they re stuff that help out  it s a great place to study uta is like the  rd most diverse school in the nation housing is pretty expensive and there are only like two nice dorms out of the entire campus  reasons why i commute lol  apartments are expensive too our teams are really good at what they do  we have sone very talented athletes  however our school spirit is very low lol i m not a greek not do i care to become one  i like to volunteer on my own not with organizations  also they seem so insignificant aside from just planning events i do not care to attend at school  people have mixed feelings towards the greeks at uta  although it s not my thing  i can agree their housing is safe and plentiful and they re involved at utarobberies happen at least once a semester  i personally think that s good considering how big uta is population wise aside from the robberies that happen after hours uta is relatively safe  it s not a party school so alcohol and drug abuse are not a big problem i like how the classes aren t too big and of course you had your really small classes  they have a variety of professors with a variety of teaching styles  however the math department sucks  they make it so much harder than it has to be  also i m not xenophobic but lecturers and lab ta s should be able to speak proper english and honestly a lot of them don t in my experience  the people who do well at uta do very well outside of it  the value of a degree from this school is directly proportionate to how hard you actually worked for it  that said  i feel the quality of the career center  services is not good at all  i think they are failing in providing students useful career advice i ve had so many different types of professors and classes at uta  and i learned something from all of them  most of them are there because they truly want their students to learn campus crime definitely is real and not exactly rare  but i think uta police does a good job of informing students of danger  as well as doing their best to prevent it there are so many options  but i never lived on campus i am not too knowledgeable about it  there is greek life and greek housing  but i was never interested in it i would choose my school again because of the enriching life experiences i was able to take part in  i ve learned a lot from interesting and diverse people that attend as students as well as faculty i am not too involved or interested in athletics at school  but find student gym is a great facility i live above campus security so i always feel safe  i love how you can call someone at night  and they can take you back to your dorm or car so you don t have to walk alone late at night  i haven t seen that at other schools and i m really glad uta decided to do something like that to protect the safety of their students classes are a lot harder here compared to the college i was attending in houston  they require a lot more time and effort  the professors are fairly helpful  however just like any other college  you will run into a bad professor like i did win my technical writing professor  but just make sure to check rate my professor online and sign up early for classes and you should be okay i am a nursing major  so this is a very excellent school for me to be at  uta has the best nursing program in the state of texas  and one of the best nursing graduate programs in the country  getting a degree here will do amazing things for me and open so many doors and possibilities  i cannot wait to graduate with my bsn from the university of texas at arlington i live in vandergriff hall and it is the best  i love how clean it is  and the rooms are very nice the greek life here is pretty small compared to what i ve seen at other universities  but i have met some great people in the greek life and i am not apart of it uta doesn t have a football team  i think that if they did  people would start attending more sporting events my professors have  for the most part  been very helpful and i have learned a lot  i ve met some great people here  and the on campus housing are nice and convienent for people like me who moved     miles away from home greek life is what keeps the school spirit lifted and just ensures an overall exciting atmosphere on campus   they have a lot of events and cook outs  which all students love   other students don t view greek students as bad  in fact  they love them for keeping campus life alive and fun  here is a few greek houses available on greek row  but the majority of greek students just live in dorms like the non greek students   the greek students here value academics and volunteering work   greek life is definitely not just for partying athletics are not a big thing at uta   we do not have a football team  but our basketball team is fairly good   our school spirit is not that great either   that is one of the downsides of uta campus life can be dead sometimes due to the big amount of students that commute  but apart from that  uta is a great university   tons of opportunities are available to help you succeed academically and the professors are very passionate and helpful   once you join organizations and become more involved in the university  a great time is guaranteed   uta really wants you to succeed there are always policemen on campus when i am around  but i do feel more safe in groups i really have not been to one of these on campus  but i have heard they are helpful my courses have been easy to manage  my professors are okay and explain what they are teaching about greek life is ok  it is most peoples thing and they join  you really do not have to be pressured into it i enjoy being enrolled at this school  the courses are taught by fantastic professors with good option hours if you need help or advising  the class sizes are surprisingly not overwhelmingly huge and i feel that i can connect better with my professors and peers  there is also a diverse amount of classes to take especially for my major  accounting   overall  uta has been a great experience so far the school has fraternities and job fairs that help us network with future employers  there are many activies that take place on campus that would look great on a resumã©  speaking of which  there are also seminars on how to write a proper resumã©  there is a lot of potential to get a great job  while still working on a degree i feel safe here on campus  even at night because the campus provides a service with campus security that escort you to wherever you need to go if it gets too dark at night  also there is a great mandatory course every student takes that informs of the risks and dangers of alcohol  drugs and bad relationships they contribute to the school and the people who join them gain a lot of opportunities very easy to access  i felt like i was given all the information i needed financial aid department is difficult to get in touch withthe area of arlington surrounding uta can be sketchy at times  but the on campus police always have a presence somewhere and do a good job preventing crime i see career events going on monthly  if you want a job directly after graduation  then you will be able to find it the courses really prepare you for your future and what you will need to know i used to not live in a dorm on campus  but now that i do i am doing better in my classes and having more fun our teams can compete with the best universities in the nation  the only lacking part is school pride  not that many people show up to games i had the opportunity to go to the university of texas at austin but i forfeited it because this place is so great  the schooling and housing and overall everything is just cheaper  the people who go to school here are great as well it s something that is well appreciated on campus  its relatively easy to form your own sports group and you get to meet many great people its a very diverse school  the people are nice and the faculty are very helpful  there are many resources available for students it s alright  typical safety school in my experience the advisers are nigh useless it s a sketchy area  but the police are helpful my ex boyfriend s dorm was really nice i don t participate enough to commentabout average for a college very diverse  some  not all  professors are brilliant and talented  getting admitted was easy and took no effortprofessors are usually helpful during class making the time meeting with them outside of class minimal  they are always open to speak to their students the value of education and a degree is very much valued  the school hold a job fair for all majors every semester giving great opportunities for internships and other occupations safety and security has never been an issue inside  there have been some robberies   assaults near parking lots in the evenings however greek life at school plays a good part in helping the community but don t thing there is enough fraternities sororities uta is a great school to experience education  it is very diverse which makes it a big feature of the school overall  athletics is pretty good  however  there is no football team so it can t be considered a big sports school basketball would probably be the most popular not a bad school  good prices  okay overallthere were multiple reports of robberythere was not a huge focus on sports uta is a great university  i have found the staff and teachers very knowledgeable friendly and helpful  i would strongly recommend it to any student wishing to fulfill their dreams there have been some assaults on campus in the past few years  but there are measures in place to fix them  one includes being walked to your car from the library if you feel unsafe nothing great about a uta degree  but it is more valuable or just as valuable as most schools professors are good  classes are decent  overall pretty good average  pretty nice  slightly costly for somenot a greek school  its a very small group of people this is not a sports college  the basketball team is the best team on campus  nut even that isn t talked about ever  if your looking for a football or sports school  look elsewhere ut arlington is a good school  it is not the most academically challenging college in texas  but the rigor of the classes is a good amount  the one problem  have with the school is the lack of a campus life  uta is a commuter school  and an international school  you do not get the same feel as a college town like where i transferred from  it feels like an extended high school with a little more freedom of what classes to take  if you do not care about the social part of college and having the college experience  ad only want to focus on school  then this is a good place for you  the clubs at uta are great and that does help meet people we have abundant security but only due to the abundant past activities that have happened herethe classes are decent but the professors are hard to approach  also  you have to study hard  the variety of classes are very limited and the class styles are very on your own approach they have careers for certain majors only  this is a very specific major school  they only look out for some majorsit s big here but not too bigi m a microbiology major and because of the extreme holds and circumstances  i couldn t enroll in the biology course that i needed  the courses are very limited if you aren t an engineering or nursing major  i have been here for almost two months and i still haven t been able to find clubs or groups to join its a very safe and comfortable campus  accomodating people from multiple diverse communities highly valued  lots of senior year employment prospectives aswell as summer internship opportunities professors are very approachable  the whole academic atmosphere is very encouraging and helpful  very bright energetic minds here campus housing is comfortable for a college dorm life  lots of options available here i am not really a lot into the whole greek experience  so my review may be inadequate to what the true experience is about the team spirit is high on campus like every other college  though further construction is always fanciful it s a great place for thosw seeking a whole range lf diversity  the experience is kind of once in a lifetime  you develop and hone skills which will definitely enable your professional progress people get mugged in the parking lot all the time and ive heard of quite a few girls being sexually assaulted at greek events  i dont feel the school does enough to prevent these things most of my professors have done a very good job  just a few here and there were just awful  the class sizes were very nice  but most of the classrooms are very ugly most of the pre med and nursing students get accepted into med  nursing school i dont really like the idea of greek life  even though the frats and sororities are not suppose to haze  i know that they do  they also all just drink all the time and the older members supply alcohol to minors at all the parties there arent many sports at this school so the athletic facilities dont really need to be amazing  there is a good workout center and a nice climbing wall though  i only wish they offered more classes for working out the school is cool  its cheap and the campus is pretty  however  i wish they had more options for classes and more assistance with helping to pick classes theres been a range of crimes from sexual assault to robberies  the school does offer a service where if you call the school police and ask for a police escort  a policeman woman will walk with you to your car in any case you do not feel safe  unfortunately this service isn t promoted or used much  they have blue call phones at parking lots in case of an emergency  the problem is anyone can come on campus  its not gated or protected in that sense  in the majority of crimes  people that aren t even students attend uta are the ones committing these crimessome courses video taped so you can go back and view them online if you missed somethingits basically paying to have friends  why join  just unnecessary groups to make more money out ofwe have no  real  football or soccer teams  they re just intramural clubs in my opinion the tuition   parking fees   book fees   lab fees are quite steep for an education  its become a business instead of a means to help people gain a better education thus better life for themselves  unless you live on campus in a dorm you have no idea what goes on  activity wise  its so hard to get involved with things when you re a commuter student  no rude or overly friendly people which is okay  they re respectful no harassment       to park in the on campus garage for one semester is ridiculous   it should be the price for a whole academic year  some teachers really expect you to be experts at their subject  its kinda ludicrous because most students do take more than one course a semester and we do have to study for multiple things  i wouldn t choose my school again if i could do it over  if i had to it would only be because it s a relatively calm environment close to home they attract a lot of studentsschool is awesome  there s a lot of support for students who need help  many activities go on here and it s just awesome no one really goes to the games or talks about the sportsgood location  and professors are helpfulit s fun   always cheering for the best there are plenty of resourcesbeing in a decent sized city exposes us to many different things  good and bad campus services on are great for safety for precautions feels like home away from home many successful people have come from uta  the area we live in has many opportunities post grad  the school does a great job preparing you for the  real world  i live in higher end campus apartments  so nothing to complain about  some on campus housing is poor quality though  pricing could be better suited for quality as well proud brother of omega delta phi  best decision i ve made since coming to college  infinite resources and support  widely misunderstood not enough school pride  nice facilities  no football   diverse students  great campus  terrible parking arrangement uta police work very hard to make sure that its a safe campus  they can be seen patrolling at all timeswhile uta may not be the best known school right now  its starting to get some recognition  degrees from uta have value and companies in the area respect the school a loti love uta  it was my first choice school and i am so grateful to have been accepted  its a good school for both commuters and those wanting to live on campus i really enjoy living in the dorms  it may not be the newest but its a place for me to go at night and i really enjoy the people i live withim not personally part of greek life but i do have several friends who are and they love it  everyone is really friendly and they re not at all offended if you re not interested in joiningthe basketball teams here are amazing as well as othersi love uta its so diverse and uniqueduring the fall we had a bit of scares when it came to armed robberies  i felt as though the situations could ve ben handled in a better way  the only time i feel uneasy is when i am walking to my car or around campus when it is dark  i prefer to walk with another person  it is scary to me to be alone the career center is a great place to go when you need guidance to a new job  they help you in countless ways ranging from resume guidance to mock interviews  i feel like this program can and will help me obtain a job after graduation i love uta and i feel like i belong here  i love how amazing the student organizations have ben to me  my favorite part of campus is the leadership center  i enjoy being involved and i am glad i was given this amazing opportunity i am a commuter student so i do not have much to say about campus housing i am non greek  so i do not have much insight on the topic  there are some groups that appear to be intimidating  but overall our greek life is pretty great though our team spirit isn t as great as i wish it would be  we still love to support our varsity teams  i have attended some basketball games and for those who actually attend are having a great time i enjoy how welcoming the campus is  all of the faculty is really good about making you feel important  i love the diversity my campus has  we have countless opportunities to meet and mingle with people from all over the world  the one thing i would have to complain about is the parking lots being further from campus  i  at times  feel unsafe when i have to walk to my car after dark  though the campus does offer a police escort an a certain time  i still don t feel to comfortable about being on campus when its dark out i feel scared to walk around campus alone when there aren t as many people around  and once the sun goes down i make sure i m constantly aware of my surroundings  the parking lots are so far away from campus that anyone could easily get into trouble since there is no one else around  we ve had multiple incidents of sexual assault  robberies at gunpoint  and actual shootings taking place near campus  i do not feel safe here at all there are a lot of career day type events that go on on campus  but i ve never personally talked to a recruiter or anything like that  i ve heard that the career center is helpful when you re having trouble finding jobs related to what you want to do  so i m planning on visiting it soon as an engineering majored student  this college relates to lots of other professors in different colleges  there will always be some different types of  forums around related to engineering field   good atmosphere to be involved studying and lots of events related to engineering field so far it has been very great  everyone ive talked to about my transfer has been wonderful  can not wait to begin classes online next month to earn a bachelors in nursing i enjoy this university because not only are the people on campus friendly  but it is an active school and they push for all students to be involved in something  i love the positive energy i feel when walking through campus and seeing organizations interact with the students and fundraising for their causes or being informative  another positive is that the school is affordable i am an international student from other country       is my first time to come to america  i have to say there are many kind and helpful professors and stuff at uta  the students are also very nice the campus is beautiful  and the student body is very diverse  the athetlic aspect isn t a huge deal  but that seems to be just fine for most students including myself  i ve liked my professors and the course material so far at uta  academics always come first  most professors will take the time to consult you one on one  even in the nursing program in classes that are a       ratio  i love how challenging the classes are  it makes me feel well prepared to enter the job market  the campus is really diverse  with important aspects of life being celebrated and talked about openly  it s nothing to see a well handled protest for rights  as well as people coming together to fundraise  academic events as well as social events are well funded and thought out  and students are able to experience all walks of college life from all the experiences i have had so far yet at uta  i would highly recommend this college to anybody who is looking for a not so big but not so small college to fulfill their career paths and career goals  it is great for just about any field out there i ve had such a great experience and i enjoy the people there   i ve learned so much since i decided to move closer to the campus  it s got a great culture and the student life is amazing  i think they could improve with the parking for students  i love the food and how there is always a starbucks near by i like the diversity of the school   the different major they offer  the advising system is great  there is always events going on at school  free stuffwhen i visited uta  i felt like i was at home with the school  the campus is beautiful and the classes are amazing  they have world renoun programs and will go one on one with you about your plan  i didn t have to choose which school i wanted to go to  it chose me the service from the administration office is very lazy because any questions that were asked were either an automatic answer that either vaguely helped or was not in context of the question or it was a person that didn t try very hard to help  one question was passed both and forth between emails and in the end it still wasn t answered and eventually i gave up  however  during a college visit they were very helpful with answering any questions and supplied detailed explanations of the college background and included commonly asked questions and answers to help the campus is beautiful and the students and staff there are so nice and will treat you like a family  the school itself is warm and inviting and since it is both twenty minutes away from dallas and forth worth it is easy to get to the texas hot spots no one has ever had a bad experience  many schools take tours  it is very close to home  there s different cultures  but what could change is the requirements to be accepted i loved the diversity and i can t wait to start taking classes and advance with my goals  hopefully i will enter the nursing program and become an nurse after completing the program  the whole university looks amazing and all the activities and recreation places are impressive i m only a freshman and almost done with the first semester and i think uta is an okay school  most students here commute  so there is not much of a university life  oh  and we don t have a football team either  the only thing i really like about uta is the diversity  you can literally walk on a street and hear   different languages spoken  i believe that uta is like the  th most diverse university nation wide i would like to change the campus atmosphere  its very dull  the campus was decorated for homecoming and i believe we should have decorations up around campus year round ut arlington is a diverse university with people from all over the world  exposure to such various cultures helps create students who can thrive in our cosmopolitan world i love the diversity of the college here  it is number five in the country in diversity among the students attending my favorite part of uta is the sense of community  students can get involved with so many different clubs and school really focuses on preparing their students for the  real world  the classes there were of great quality  but i would love to see more improvements on offering scholarships or grants because i feel like it is hard for some students to find the right offerings for them  also  the campus is kinda small  only offering a limited amount of housing  and some of them are even too costly  it would be great if there are more dorms available and cheaper for students to afford the professors at this school are great  they love what they teach so it s actually entertaining to listen to the lectures  the classes are huge  so that s not the greatest thing  but the professors still care about every student  there are so many different courses offered here that i m surprised at what some fellow students are taking after staying in the dorms i felt like i had completely wasted all of the money i had spent  i had a bad experience with the cleanliness of my dorm  there was a ton of mold   plus the roommate matching didn t go so well  there was lots of activities to do at the dorms though  like volleyball  videogame tournaments  etc we don t have much greek life on our campus since we only have a few different sororities fraternities  personally  i see them as somewhat snobby and difficult to talk to  it s also hard to get involved because of the cost  our greek life isn t even big and it still cost thousands to get involved in it the biggest sport at my school is basketball  which seems to be pretty popular  we have a great team  so i think that s why so many people enjoy attending the games  however  this is the only sport that anyone pays attention to  if we had a football team  i think people would get more involved in sports most of the professors at my school are incredibly talented in their fields  it s amazing listening to them talk about something that they love  however  i think that the science programs could be better  specifically the labs   if i could do it all over  i would probably have gone with my first choice school  but uta seemed like the more affordable option  at the time  this was the best choice for me haven t had any terrible incidents besides a car being broken into once out the two years i have been there  i feel safe walking around campus at nightteachers are open for office hours oftentowards senior year is when networking is great for you and advisors are always there to help youvery calming and clean while walking to classnot sure what greek life isi have not seen to many issue in my time at ut arlington ut arlington is a decent school  it s a good commuter choice for those in the dfw area  professors know what they re talking about for the most part and campus life is slowly getting better as time goes on a degree from ut arlington will obviously depend on the major you decide to get  but overall it is a respected school we only have a basketball team and a softball team  so not many go to the gamesi like the fact that i am at the point in my college career where i only have to take my intended major classes now dorms have a wide range  the cheaper dorms are definitely that  cheap  however arlington  kc  and vandergriff hall are all extremely nice greek life is pretty low key in arlington  the majority of the kids here are commuters which hampers the ability of greek life to shoot off the gym is very new and nice to use  only the basketball and volleyball teams are competitive and worthwhile watching diverse commuter school with decent campus life  not top tier  but not terrible they are extremely helpful and want you to succeedthe career center gives student a lot of options and help to get student organized for future careersthe school is located in a not so great part of town the local area is not very safegreek life is pretty neutralother than the turner over of academic advisers  the school experience has been great there is a lot of dorms and apartments to choose form  the rent is not too bad  but there is a big sense of community within the dorms although there is not a lot of greek houses on campus there is still a huge community for any and all interested in joining greek life the mac  maverick activity center  is a giant two story complex that houses multiple basketball courts  rock climbing room  indoor soccer room  and tons of weight lifting and exercise equipment for students to remain active and healthy to start off my school is pretty huge  this means that there is tons of opportunities for all types of people  there s a wide range of clubs and events for students to get involved in whether it is extracurricular or academic  and the school does a lot to put the different clubs and events out there such as activity fairs and an entire website dedicated to showing what all organizations the school has to offer i feel very safe here  so much so even at nightevery professor is unique and i am the person i am today because of who they were there are opportunities to succeed  we just need to know where to look for themi love trinity hall  i am definitely considering living in the same room that i am living in nowi m not to sure exactly what it is that they do  but i haven t heard any stories of vandalism or rape or murder  so they are the best    i love the athletics facility  i am at the gym at least three times a week  it is a great way to end the day with a quick run on the track or a couple of reps the bench press i love the opportunity that i was given to such an awesome and amazing campus  everyday i learn something new  and i am not just talking about in the classroom  no  i am talking about the groups here on campus  this university is known for its diversity  but i say  there is more to diversity than how someone looks  and i have got to say  the diversity of ideas definitely spans the spectrum of ideologies  from christians and atheists to nurses and engineers  this campus has alot to offer  you just need to know where to look and where to go it all depends on what fraternity or sorority you jump into  some focus too much on partying  while others focus heavily on the culture and morals of their fraternity as a whole i haven t had any issues with the university  the people here are kind  unique  and have generally varying background that make the entire experience exciting i generally feel pretty safe on campus and i haven t had a problem yet from what i ve experienced  it s all pretty good   nothing much to complain about personally  i ve found the school to be very likable not a big athletic college i feel very safe on campusthe professors are really helpful and nicethere are a lot of opportunities on campus and ways to get internships through utai don t live in uta housing but ive heard it is greatit is a great way to meet peoplethe athletics are very fun to watch and attendit is a great schoolclinic on campus is free and available to everyonei am a member of greek life and i love itta s are not helpful at allwalking from class to class  i always see some frat or sorority stand around  trying to sell baked   or barbequed   goods or raising awareness for some kind of cause  greek life at uta is nice because they provide goods services and they don t get in your face about it so if you don t want to participate in it  you can just avoid iti live off campus  around    minutes from the school  so i don t really participate in the athletics part of the school  however  it is easy to see how big sports are around campus   i m constantly getting emails about new games  etc and there always seems to be something going on with some sport that is advertised everywhere  for those more sports inclined  it is not at all difficult to find something to cheer foralthough smaller than most schools  it s growing it s smaller than most colleges  but looks positivebasketball is the big sport here  and they re goodall has been great  but some registration was hardathletic events aren t really attended only homecoming  no footballit s a beautiful campus  with many opportunities there is always something happening as far as safety is concerned  there are constant robberies going on especially in parking lots on campus jobs are easy to find  internships are harder to get  i have not yet used the career center so i am not aware of how helpful it is so far  i find the school to be very diverse and accepting of all kinds of people  the courses offered are the only thing i have trouble with  for my major  there aren t enough classes being offered each semester  i am happy with the class sizes its always been very easy to communicate with and understand the professors i have personally no experience with campus housing but i do have friends who live on campus  i have heard from them how small rooms can be i have personally never been involved but i always see the different events they have going on around campus and it seems very welcoming and fun i have personally never been involved in any kind of athletic activity on campus my experience with uta has been okay  managing classes  the homework load  help from professors and other resources its all been nice  the only thing i have had trouble with every semester is dealing with finding the classes i need the overall experience is alright  i expected more from this school  the tuition fees are a lot for international students which is a bit of a problem however  the administration is good there are no sports that i attend  mostly because of market  i never know about them and when i find out about them  the reviews aren t always the best  also  i believe because of it  there is real no school spirit the people are great  the professors are great for the most part  the school is okay  however  i do not see myself growing in this department  it is a safety school for me  because it is affordable and close to home i ve had good experiences with most of the professors i ve had  the ones i didn t was mainly because they were disorganized the main professors in my program were formerly professionals in the field and have invaluable resources available the nursing major at uta is one of the highlights of uta  uta nursing is ranked number one in texas i feel safe at school  but not around the apartment around the school with the major i m going with  nursing   it is most likely that one will guaranteed a job when one graduates from uta uta has a lot of people in one some classes  which can degrade the level of learning environment but the labs in uta are great uta has a lot of international students  therefore  it is a very diverse school with great nursing program  the overall people  like students and staff and professors  are nice and easy to get along with overall  security is great on campus  there are call poles everywhere  and the walkways are brightly lit at night i highly enjoyed working with my professors throughout the semester  they are there for you and will help you succeed as long as you show you want to excel  get in a fig if you can  the study groups are really nice if you want to get in to brazos  you have to apply in the fall of the previous year  i e  fall      if you re an incoming freshman for fall     safety isnt an issue for most people anymoreclasses can be tough  but thats collegeif you re a dedicated student who wants to go into nursing  who loves a diverse atmospehere  and who loves to be academically challenged  then uta is right for you  i was pleasantly surprised to see how the campus cared and wants you to succeed  rnrnif there was one thing i could change about uta   it would be parking  i was almost late for a test  i got there an hour early   some  because all of the garages were full  be prepared for some tough parking if you re a commuter room was fine  but roommate suckedi like our greek life  its getting bigger too our baseball and basketball teams are really goodi like ut arlington a lot it s a great schoolthe dorms are good on campus  the meal plan required is rather dissatisfying though if you are under    it is hard to get stuff to do legally the parties are thrown by greeks   they have ridiculous requirements to enter athletic teams are good  but they have little support typical greek life  it requires a financial payment the study lounges in the dorms are a positive step there are constantly multiple police patrols out at the same time considering the vast amount of students that attend  it is still possible to proceed down your path there should be more jobs on campus open to students it s very diverse and helps you appreciate every cultureso hard to get into and unfairvery open and friendly enviornmentright now it seems like there are more students than there is class space  many classes fill up quickly without the addition of more options  you have to be diligent to register early i don t know that any campus feels completely safe nowadays  being a male  a sexual assault is not a concern to me  but violent attacks on campus are  i am looking forward to the campus carry law that is taking effect this next year  i think that law will help deter attacks from happening on campuses in texas i have absolutely no desire to join a fraternity  i feel like  greek life  on campus is somewhat out of control  they pollute the campus with noise and obstructions so far i am satisfied with my choice in schools  the most difficult process has been getting registered for classes  the process is overly complicated and repetitive  and it often feels like no one knows who i should talk to  last semester i was sent in a circle of four or five people multiple times before i was finally able to figure out who i was supposed to communicate with  rnrnsome of the professors seem to care about the material that they are teaching  and they enjoy working with students  but i often feel like teaching is is the last thing on their mind and classroom prep suffers i am not concerned about athletic programs that a campus provides  i am glad that i attend a school without a football program  the workout facility is very nice  and i am happy that i have access to it very fun time learning at uta  had great professors and lots of interning classes hat have taught me a lot security is definitely pretty tight around the campus  but i do feel a lot more safe there they were very personal when teaching and gave students lots of room to ask questions and understand the topic this school has a great kinesiology program which is what i am going into  i think graduating from this big of a school will already be plenty good enough for many jobs i will find they have some very nice apartments on campus they volunteer a lot  it s fun  i play softball there and i love it i used things i learned in the classroom in everyday life there have been a number of security issues in only one semester and it makes me feel uneasy  i want to walk around feeling safe i do not like it or the options or the proximity  but i understand  you get what you can affordi am not in any greek society because i personally do not think i have time for that and it is not something i will be interested in  but they seem to have fun and enjoy themselves  would recommend to someone who is all about thatit is just fine  i do not think i need anything more  the mac is greati do like it at uta  there are definitely some improvements that can be made especially with the residence halls and apartments  but all in all  love it here i love the structure of the online courses  they are centered around what you should learni have loved all of the professors i have hadi think i will have many opportunities upon graduationi love it  i was originally at a community college in austin  i feel like i am going  somewhere with uta  and all of the professors are incredibly helpful as well as the staff  i had an opportunity to attend university of texas at austin and still chose arlingtoncampus hosuing gets the students a chance to know each other the athletics show our school spirit greek life gives off an enthusiastic vibe i feel pretty safe on campus within the first couple of months  there have been three gun related incidences  two of them armed robberies in the campus parking lot and another where a non student had on gun on campus  only down the hall from where i was   there has also been a sexual assault right outside of campus with a student as a victim  earlier this month campus police and arlington police department blocked the architecture building because of a possible suspect with a large gun  however it was only a tripod  during that incident  i feel the police should have closed off the outside of the architecture building more because this suspect could have had a rifle  rnrnoverall the police do what they can the courses are very straight forward of course it all depends on your major  but as a math major it is very difficult to get a supportive math professor  some professors are really good but most are foreign so it is really hard to understand them when it comes to teaching a topic  as far as the topics go  they are tedious and down to detail so know your background knowledge and be prepared to always practice and have a ton of course work because uta is a very diverse school  the best way to create your career outside of getting the degree is networking with people  really get to know your professors that you believe will help you in your future  the career center is the best place to go when it comes to finding the perfect job for on campus or after you graduate  they are very helpful and guide you through the process of having a successful career uta is in the process of bringing back a vibrant greek lifestyle  most greeks are very helpful to the school and to the community and with uta being a very diverse campus there s a sorority or fraternity for everyone since uta almost every sport except football  most of the students concentrate more on their studies and or participate in intramural sports  because of the lack of athletics and the number of commute students there s not a lot of school spirit to support most sports if you are a commute student  this is school is the perfect safety school  however make sure you get a good parking spot  also if you are a transfer student  this may not be the school for you because of the barely any to none scholarships they offer transfer students and since most of these classes are hard  don t count on your transfer gpa to help you i love living on campus and i glad i choose to or i d be driving in arlington traffic every day  the residence hall i live in is the best because it s like living in my own little apartment just without the kitchen area  i live in a suite with   other roommates and we share a bathroom and living area  i like that we have mutiple lounge areas to study or socialize in  i dislike that on my floor    st floor  particularly that we only have   washing machines available and sometimes only   because people do not know how to wash their laundry even with signs above them telling people how to  my residence hall is the closest to the student center which holds almost everything including the post office  the cafe  places to study  and a convient store  the price was a little bit much because living there requires that you have a meal plan but it s worth it and the housing process was super easy greek life at uta is very involved with our community and they love to give back whether its to the actual arlington community or a charity  the greeks are very nice and do not exclude anyone because they are non greeks  the only greek housing available is of course only for the ifc phc and not other greeks like nphc  national pan hellenic council  or mgc  multicultural greek council  i personally am not interested in any of the sports that play during the fall besides football and because we do not have a football team i have to motivate myself to go watch our basketball team  our men s basketball team this fall has been  killing it   i think they are one of the best in our league right now from what i see at the games i ve been to  we have a lot of school spirit and mostly all of campus comes to support especially when they give out free goodies like t shirts  i can t wait until this upcoming spring semester because i am a fan of baseball softball i finished my first semester at uta and honestly my time here as changed my perspective about the school  i thought this school was just going to be like high school and that i wouldn t be able to get the  college experience  because it is so close to home but it feels like a whole new world  uta is so diverse from professors to students and they are all friendly and we come together as a community to help eachother  one of my favorite experiences so far  kind of bad thinking back on it  but there was a stick up in one of our student parking lots  lot     and there was a student that made  straight outta lot     shirts with  stay viligant  on the back and every shirt bought the proceeds went to a charity  i thought that was really cool because it brought awareness about campus safety and it helped others in need  if i could do it all over again i would still pick uta as my final choice  whenever old high school friends that are graduating in      ask if they should apply for uta i tell them absolutely i am in kc hall and it is great  it s very clean and spacious and the ras are nice   it s on campus so it is a lot faster to get to classes without having to wake up really early and fighting for parking this school doesn t have a football team so there s not one sport that the whole student body roots for   there is basketball and volleyball but it isn t the same   the school spirit is very low and the games don t have a huge turnout   the facilities are very nice though overall it is an okay school  the one thing that i really don t like about it is that there is not any unifying school spirit   everyone wears different school shirts and most people are commuters so the campus doesn t have any nightlife i feel pretty safe  at night i stay in a group or talk on the phone to make sure if something happens someone knows  but nothing has ever happened to me most of my professors were great  but i had one teacher that graded weird which kind of effected my grade when i should ve done betterit s great   i have learned so much and met alumni sometimes it s great food  other times it s alright but not uneatablei didn t join a sorority but my roommate did and she loves it i don t go to games but i hear about them and people love going to games we were robbed in the same parking lot twice in the same week my professors are great instructors whom i feel truly care that i learn their language and involve myself in their clubs the career center will help you if you need it  but you have to put forth the effort to find them i m attempting to live on campus  it s very expensive but hopefully will be worth it i don t deal much with greek life so i can tour an opinion i don t really attend the events on campus for sports and they are moderately advertised i love going to uta   there s tons to do regarding extracurricular a and academics  i just wish that their russian program had more professors rather than two with only one teaching the language uta is a great school where i have met many new people and have succeeded in my first semester academics are great  i really enjoy my classes and the professors  the nursing program is very competitive and rigorous  but i believe well worth the time and effort the university sends out an alert through a text or email if something is going on on campus  the shorthorn also informs students of the current happenings on campus i m sure it s great  i don t know very much about the student career prospects or the value of a degrees from this school yet overall my experience for only a semester at the university is good  i like a lot of what they have to offer academically  i just wish that it wasn t such a big commuter school my experience with campus housing had been fine   in august when i first moved in the dorm was filthy  i had to clean just about everything in the dorm  i also don t like how far the parking lot is to my dorm  it s a pain in the butt to bring groceries or my overnight bag to and from my dorm room i am a new member of the sorority alpha chi omega  i really enjoy it  i have met some great people  i don t know what non greeks think about greeks  some members of the sorority or fraternity do live in their house  i don t know specifically how many it is for each i have yet to attend an athletic event  but i have heard great things about our basketball and volleyball teams so far my overall experience has been alright  as a nursing major at uta my program is very academically competitive  i enjoy my classes and the professors for the most part  however  the majority of uta is made up of commuters which makes meeting people you can hang out with outside of class very difficult  even many students who live on campus go home on the weekends  as a student who s home is four hours away from uta i don t have the convenience of going home as often as everyone else  therefore i typically feel alone on campus on weekends nursing attracts large number of students because of its credibility frequent workshops  and recruiting events on campus some of the classes i attended were huge       students   professor  student ratio is relatively high few incidents on parking lot have created fear on students to walk alone in some areas  school police provides    hour escort service if asked located close to classes  library  restaurants  and activity centers various activities of greek organizations don t let school be boring or lonely high diversity of students  affordable  and good study environment  multiple organizations for assisting veterans  i wouldn t trust administration   and advising fully though does not have football  men s basketball attracts a large crowd  great activity center  and other facilities many crimes happen in the parking lots of campusthey make you look at your futureprofessors are very helpful if you are willing to askno football team but great men s basketball teamut arlington ranks top   in diversity among the usi tend to get text messages and emails when something happens on campus regarding our safety  i really appreciate them sending out the message to everyone so that we can be aware of what has taken place on our campus  i feel very comfortable walking by myself on campus no one has ever made me feel uncomfortable at anytime while here at ut arlington i feel like the student body really wants to achieve the getting their degree from uta  i myself can not wait to receive my degree from ut arlington  although i haven t seen that many employers on campus i feel like if i reach out more to different organizations here on campus they will be able to help me find the field of work  i ve always wanted to work in the very first class i took at ut arlington was personality psychology  it was an extremely big class  coming for a community college  however  the professor managed to keep us engaged with his lectures and jokes greek life at my school is not really promoted that much  however we do have some greek organizations that people can join in  when school first started they had all of there signs up trying to recruit the student body to join their organization  i don t think the greek students are looked down upon  the greek students that i ve meet have all been very nice and helpful whenever a games coming up i always get a super pumped up exciting flyer and or email  the student body is always excited and ready to cheer on our team  i love the fact that everyone has faith in our teams and is always rooting for them  just the excitement and school spirit it s self makes you want to attend a game to support the mavs i love ut arlington  because everyone is so friendly  i love going to study in the library it s one of my favorite locations on campus  i would definently pick this school again if given the chance because i absolutely love the school greek is the beginning the school behavior to success i do involve in this problem  i hope to be minimize as much as you can the night transportation are great  they can go any place when they wanted the party often happen in the weekend  everyone mostly participate in the party they always has once a year lecture about sexual orientation they have mostly every subject you want to learn the class size is great  it is about thirty student in one class  so the students can communicate the professors easily the campus network is accessible the student  the internet speed is normal to do homework the campus crime same like does not in the campus living in a dorm is expensive but you have more time to study and focus on the school work i like being in the urban because you could easily get the thing you wanted  also students are nice and professors are incredible  they inspired me to be a better person every day my school basketball team has a great team work  almost a half of the court come to watch every game there has been quite a bit of crime on campus  but i still do not feel particular unsafe i know that graduating with a bsn from uta will ensure with me with a job right off the bat so far at uta  i have had a good experience  the class sizes are good  the professors are helpful  the curriculum is pretty good  and the students are all pretty friendly i do not live on campus again  i do not know much about greek life i do not get very involved in the athletics life of the university  so i do not really know too much about it so far  i have found that most professors at ut arlington are always ready to help and want their students to succeed the college that i chose is a good choice for me because it is close to home and is easily accessible  the professors are great and they really do care about the experiences of the students and make sure that they understand what is happening in each course and make sure that the students are having a good experience i love everything about the university it makes me feel at home  uta is a great school to attend  the class are great and the people on are campus are awesome  arlington is a great community to be ininitially wouldn t accept my transfer credits so i had to retake a lot of classes wasting time and money to get where i am now  but it was worth it uta has been a fabulous school to obtain my graduate degree   the program is entirely online   the professors are incredibly helpful and knowledgeable uta is one of the most diverse universities around   i am currently a grad student and love my colleagues  my professors and the newer downtown campus available for business students    i did attend for a large portion of my undergraduate classes as well and had nothing but success   the campus life is amazing   if you have an opportunity to live on campus  it is definitely a oncfe in a lifetime experience my school visit to the university of texas at arlington was absolutely amazing   this school had met all of my requirements for my dream university  the campus wasn t too shocking big and it was very diverse   the class rooms were pretty big though   but on the other hand   the school had so many student founded organizations and clubs   uta is an incredible institution with nice staff members and great food options  the campus is a great medium sized campus  not too big  not too small  they have a great architecture program  the campus is also growing and they are adding some new on campus features like a dining hall and residence halls one of the main things i enjoy about uta is that it is extremely diverse  with coming to this campus i have met plenty of people from all parts of the world i love how diverse the university is  there are many associations on campus to get involved in  it is a friendly environment overall i would say this is a perfect school if you are a transfer student  this school brings forth a lot of opportunity and diversity  if someone was looking for a way to be involved in the community and a school that is all about their students i would say this school is for them  now  along with the pros i do have to mention some cons  the downside to this university is how expensive it is  for        a year  there is no teacher s aid to assist when professors are not available  it cost to do everything on campus including printing  there is always a line to enter the library  and due to construction parking is very limited  i attended another university before coming to this one and their tuition was        less and i never had an issue with any of the above i do like it here  the campus is quite beautiful for texas  i ve had almost completely positive experiences with professors  the only negative experiences i ve had is with professors of      s level classes as being a college freshman student in the university of texas at arlington  i have learned a lot  each of my professors are really nice and are determined to help me  what i like about this university is that is a very outgoing university  there is a lot of opportunities to succeed in the path of my future career of becoming a nurse  i also like that i feel safe when being on campus  the uta police do take their job serious and make sure everyone feels and be safe  what i would like to see a change on is a decrease in the number of students on classes       there should be several classes so students don t have to attend a class of      students  it s really hard for students who have to sit on the back pay attention to the lecture and be able to see  i always need to be    minutes early in order to find a seat on the front to be focus in the lecture  other than that  the university of texas at arlington is the great fit to continue my education the school is good however i feel that the campus is kind of ugly  i also hate the fact that we don t have a football team even though we  are a d  school what i liked about this college is that it had different facilities that were easily located and were not very hard to find  the people are great at this university and very friendly  i can easily take the bus from my home to the university and visit at any time i liked all the student body as a whole  and they helped me make my choice of attending their next fall more easierthis was one of the top schools on my list of dream colleges   the campus is very nice and filled with helpful staff  all my professors so far have been great im not in uta but i plan on going there around fall of      i have been there a couple of times and have a couple of friends that go there i enjoyed the student environment at ut arlington because there are endless opportunities to get involved on campus  i especially enjoyed participating in the baptist student ministry on campus  the staff at ut arlington desire success for their students and were extremely helpful with any question i ever had  there are study session for almost every class i took  which saved my grade several times in a couple of classes  the campus is also clean and safe  which is important to me in a place where i spend much of my time  nut arlington is the fifth most diverse university in the country  experiencing so many cultures was an incredible experience which i am strongly grateful for while completing my application for graduate school  hurricane harvey hit the texas coast   it was challenging getting all the necessary documentation to them by the deadline  their admissions department was phenomenal in emailing updates to me and taking the special circumstances into consideration  very professional and courteous i m a freshman and so far the school is really good  i ve already made friends and my professors take the right amount of time to cover the material we go over  there are many groups and clubs that i would consider joining  also the campus is beautiful and has many spots for studying i like the campus size and although it is a big school it was easy to find my way around the campus uta is a great school  i would start over and attend more activities so that i could be more involved and enjoy the college life  my favorite thing is working out at the campus gym with my friends overall  i love the college that i m going too for the most part the college has been very easy to navigate thru  many of the courses and assignments are doable  and are able to get goo grades on  but if you get an academic coach who is unfair  and will not be objective to what is needed  then you are screwed  you can find yourself waiting days to hear about what is needed in an assignment with only   day to complete an assignment that can be labor intensive uta is an awesome school  they encourage diversity and their professors are the best i love uta because it is so diverse and the faculty and staff are helpful it s the only school in the area with a spanish translation and interpreting program as my goal was to achieve a ba in linguistics  my options were somewhat limited  however  if i had known how many opportunities and field experiences i would have  i would have gone to uta sooner  the involvement of the professors in the success of their students in the linguistics department is nothing short of amazing the campus is very open and great for walking  i wish there were more dining options near campus i am loving the college experience at uta  the advisors and professors are very helpful in making all students here successful  i enjoy that my advisor emails me often about upcoming events  community service opportunities  and job opportunities  i would choose the university of texas in arlington again over and over i have been to the campus a couple of times to talk to counselors and finicial aid avdvisors  this campus is very open and has a great outdoor feel  i attend school completely online currently but the teachers i have had so far online are amazing and very hands on still with the questions i ever have very fun school with many diversities and culturesif you are involved on campus you know more people and are more likely to get out of your shell i love uta  i ve grown so much as a person and leader by attending this school  i ve had several wonderful opportunities to see the world from a different perspective and i find that amazing i really like the university of texas at arlington   however  my favorite professor recently passed away   i miss him my school doesn t do as many activities as i was  expecting  but other than that the school is okayut arlington has one of the most beautiful campuses i have ever seen  and the weather  amazing  the campus itself is so relaxed and houses some of the nicest and diverse group of human beings i have encountered  the school itself admits it   they take pride in how diverse they are   from having a club for just about everything to celebrating ethnic and cultural days of importance and having festivals celebrating their cultural diversity  the teachers and staff are all nice and willing to help you with anything  the only thing that could be better was the financial aid department  especially when applying as a cap student  overall the experience has been very amazing but be very affirmative when dealing with financial aid because they tend to push you aside a lot calculus one was very enjoyable at the university of texas at arlington  the school of social work program is amazing  i ve grab so much more in just one year of grad school than in my entire year of undergrad at a different school  i ve really connected with my teachers and classmates  my classmate are actually turning into close friends i really don t have anything to compare it to other than community college  i went to a community college where the online component was better  both in terms of technology and offerings  but it can t compare with the number and depth of courses offered at the university the school i am currently attending is ok but i wish i went to the school where all my highschool friends are ati enjoy this school because they provide an awesome online program while i m having some major complaints about some professors and their inability to teach  the school is okay  its difficult to get your adviser to help at first  and you pay a huge amount of money for a class with barely any material sometimes i love my school and my campus  it s not too big nor is it too small  it s perfectly fit for me its ok my teachers are nice and we do meaningful things  we are learning our basics  met a few new people this year only one freshman the campus and the people are great  you get the university experience without having to move from home nice school  great for engineering it was very difficult to get into the class of my choice due to late registration the registration process has be tough but it s mainly due to my ignorance on the stepsmy experienced was very good i went with some of my school mates i like the diversity and the many opportunities to learn about what the school has to offer and the help that s always available i love the university spirit and how the campus has an enormous amount of support available to the students it has been a good experience so far so far  the school  students  teachers  and campus look amazing and i feel like this will help my career i love uta  the campus is beautiful  the teachers are wonderful  and the student body is very diverse and accepting  the mavs      class that freshman are required to take has potential  but was not helpful at all when i had to take it i am very excited to attend the university of texas at arlington because it is close to home and is exactly what i am looking for  i would chose this school over any other school my overall experience at school was when i became a class officer for my sophomore year because it was fun and i got to become a leader  having avid here helping students with getting ready for college is what makes my school unique  why i would choose my school all over again if i could is because it is such a great campus for any student  the teachers here are really great teachers  and the avid program is an awesome program for college ready students i chose my school because it was more affordable than most i am excited for campus life  the freshmen orientation gave good information about college and what to expect  they give good scholarships  and have a friendly environment the school i am currently attending is pretty good  the professors are great ut arlington is the best because of the amazing amount of diversity  first and foremost  it is the fifth most diverse university in the entire nation  and that really makes me feel at ease being an asian student  the amount of school pride here is just overwhelming  everything is about  blue and orange  and you ll always be told to  mav up  anywhere you go  people come here for the prestigious nursing or engineering programs  but i just love feeling like at my home away from home teachers are okay but the advisors suck i enjoy my school cause it s got a nice campus and the area around it is full of places to go and stuff to do  i chose it mainly because of location  it s about an hour from home so it s not too close i would probably love the school a lot more if there was more school spirit around campus throughout the entire year university of texas at arlington as exposed me to much more better community around the campus area rnrnit is very interesting to learn in the same environment with different kind of culture  race and background rnrni plan to go for my grad school here at uta again because of the love i have derived in the dfw area the professors and more importantly the advising staff are there to help you uta is a very diverse university   you will undoubtably be able to find people like yourself as well as be able to come into contact with many new cultures it s an amazing school  the teachers want to help you succeed and student tend to help each other out  the advisor s are great they make knowing what s next very ready and explain everything very carefully so you can understand what you have to do i love everything about the school it is fun and an inexpensive aim at university knowledge i love me school    i originally was attending an other university but it just was not a right fit for me  i feel more at home at my university compare to anywhere else there s a lot i like about the school  the people  the facilities  intramurals  etc  the only thing i dont like about the school is that there isnt a football team and that its predominatly a commuter school grading policy is not based on traditional numbers  a        university of texas at arlington  uta  overall look pretty good  i  think i m going to like it here uta is an excellent school  everyone i have come into contact with here has been friendly and helpful  as a returning student  i have appreciated the positive experience university of texas at arlington is a large campus with an small campus atmosphere which makes it easy to adjust into the college lifestyle i really like uta as a school  there are so many ways a student can receive help with academics  and it is also as affordable as college can be  however  the school seems a bit out dated and its not so much of a lively campus as other division one schools are the english department is fairly small and everyone forms a community of openness and discussion  the university has made a large effort to create an even bigger community and has been successful overall i m happy with the decisions i ve made so far  i went to a community college and got my associates degree then transferred to a university  my only regret was that i should ve paid attention to the school i was going to transfer to and see what courses were required when i need help  i know it is always availible  if i need help with math  then i go to the math lab  if i need help with a writing assignment  then i go to to writing center  the campus is large  always feels alive i love uta  it s close to home  it s  affordable   as affordable as a   year school can get   the faculty and staff care  it s easy to get involved i have lived on campus for the past two years  but i do have friends that live off campus and for the most part they enjoy the cheaper cost of their apartments  the only problem is having to drive to campus and find parking i don t really attend parties other than those hosted by the actual university  the annual block party is a great campus event i like to got to fuzzy s tacos which provide a convenient close location for tex mex food  the flying fish provides healthy sea food options and has student discounts  potagers is also a good restaurant that is healthy and organic the campus staff works a lot in keeping the students updated in any danger situations  and cares about bettering their security system people do complain about the connection cafe  but it has good food options if you explore the available lines instead of just opting for the safety of burgers all the time  pie five and coolberry frozen yogurt are the better campus restaurants to go and spend your college park dollars at  the pod can be overpriced  but it s good for emergencies when you can t go to an actual store my two years at uta have been covered by the combined total of scholarships and financial aid  the university scholarship information is provided to anyone online and most scholarship applications are pretty easy to complete vandergriff hall is close to classes  the cafeteria  and campus restaurants  it provides a safety feeling with the enforcement of having to slide your id to enter the building and your dorm lot s of options  most of it is cheap enough for people like me to eat near the school everyday instead of waiting until you get homethere s nothing particularly detrimental  nor is there anything particularly supplemental for the student in the school policies  you just follow them  if you don t follow them you risk consequences  simple as thati just got the outstanding freshman scholarship for my school and that s basically the only reason i m able to attend  i m not sure how to apply for scholarships i don t really know to much about off campus housing but i m sure its just as good as on campus haven t went to any parties yet but i hear they are fun there are tons of food places all around the school you cant get there without passing one up they very clear on what the policies are i ve never eaten it but all i hear is good things it took a little while to receive but i got it no problemi have not had very good interactions with the administration  they are not very reachable  and they make you pay basically to walk from your car to class i have only eaten on campus a few times with friends  the food is alright  nothing special  each time i just opted for a salad i don t eat on campusthe process went well but this year that i want to re applied they did not inform me that i need    hours  so its becoming a nightmarei do not care much for the greek life  but mainly because i did not want to be apart of it  most people do not like the greek students or just do not really care for  but everyone has their own opinion  it all depends on the greek affiliation  some are really chill and cool with good goals  others not so much very good programs for sexual assault prevention  drug and alcohol abuse  emergency preparedness  safe sex  and much more  there are a few crimes on campus  but that will happen in nearly any college  police are nice and will assist when asked  i feel perfectly safe on campus at all times the activities center and the intramural fields are very nice  the other athletic facilities are also nice for the varsity students  our big team here is basketball  although most students do not care or would prefer football instead  yet there are faithful students who would faithfully attend the events  and the all sports pass is very cheap  only     for access to all events year long plenty of places around arlington for variety of food in a good range of prices  my personal favorite is bethany s   minutes from campus  by car  as long as you follow the honor code  do not cheat  and obey campus rules  everything will be fine they are quick to answer my questions  they are much better to deal with in person or over the phone the dorms on campus allow you to get more involved with the activities on campus  as well as having their own  there are plenty of perks of living in dorms  such as a kitchen  cable  and study lounges it an ongoing process lengthy  they had an error with finding my parents tax transcript which caused more time but they resolved it after i called fafsathe gyms are ok but comparing to some of the bigger schools not so goodthere are tons of apts and homes for you to move in to at any point of the yearif you are looking for a party its easy to find one  people are friendly  drunk and high and will share everything with you not even knowing you there are a number of places you can walk to and enjoy a good quality meal or mcdonaldsthey aren t horrible but not great  the follow the rules but do let some things slide  those things will be easy to pick up on i have the uta scholarship with a grant that covers my school feesthey do have chik fil la and subway but not to many options in the ucit all depends on what do you prefer  wifi  computer access  and party they have  if you are looking for peace and quite ad a place to study not going to happen  good thing the library is closethe options for off campus housing are limited and some of the places are very sketchy and dangerous  the housing office is not very helpful when it comes to this option a student has to drive to find places off campus and not very many options offer discounts there are not enough officers for the whole campus  incidents are always occuring and the criminals don t seem to ever get arrested  parking is the worst  a person has to drive to different lots to be able to find parking  it is ridiculous that a cuple hundred dollars is spent on the parking ticket and very little options for paking are available the process was long  i got a lot of money but that only covered my tuition and i was left with no options for rent  health insurance or books  i was not pleased with financial aid the cafeteria offers only carbs and very little salad options and not much variety of options  the plates are very expensive   and not worth the money  the appareal at the pod should be available for purchase with the dining dollars and this money should also be available for use at the collegepark restaurants though the facilities are really nice and privacy is insured  the cost of living is very expensive and the requirements to pay for    cafeteria food in order to live in an specific builiding is absurd  more money is spent on the dorms that living on a regular apartment  also  finding apartments on campus for out of state or international students is a hassle and a very long process i love off campus and i love it  no dealing with the housing office and no on campus rules or restrictions  cost may be a little high but more privacy options are available lots of options and many places to eat that have student discounts  the prices aren t the best but hey we have to eat i do not party so i don t know the best  party scene  but i do know that the best way to have a good time is to have good friends will give you a ticket for coughing while crossing the street i ve heard great things about it and people never seem to have problems with it although the meal plans are expensive and the food quality is low in the connection cafe it is food and for a hungry college student it works  the plaza has good options that are available often  einsteins is great for all coffee and bagel lovers  and is on the other side of campus which give variety the housing has two worlds here at uta  there are very old housing options and very new housing options  for the new ones they are clean and spacious but the amenities are lacking  the washers and dryers hardly ever work  shower water pressure was minimal  fixtures would often break and fending machines were rarely on or working  the old ones are dirty  and not spacious at all  no elevators in them and that limits the handicapped i looked for an apartment either near campus or on campus  and ended up choosing on campus  the off campus housing is more expensive overall because not all utilities are included in the outrageous rent  on campus has utilities included  the off campus ones are not near as safe either  i have heard many bad things about the nearby off campus apartments as far as safetyi am not a party person  so i don t know how the good the parties actually are  however i have heard about a lot of parties and so there s definitely a party scenei prefer to eat off campus  it is usually cheaper than on campus  and being in arlington there are a ton more of options i have not been here very long  but it seems like the policies are pretty strict  i parked outside an office building for   minutes while i was inside fixing paperwork and when i cam out my car was being towed financial aid from the school  apart from fafsa  is given out based on set rules  only the smartest people really get financial helpthe meal plan is too expensive so i have not had one  the restaurant options on campus are great though  there are many choicesi really like the size and location of the school  it also has so many great opportunities i would not know about off campus housingeverything uta does is very good and strict i looked at the school scholarships but it was too late to applyyou always have food even if you run out at your dormliving on campus is fun and exciting  you get in on all the extra activities uta isn t a big sports schoolthere are lots of places within walking distance of campus that it s pretty affordablethe president is not willing to listen to student grievances the connection cafe is awful  but the plaza has really good fast food there are so many options for off campus dining  since some places on campus close early and aren t open on the weekends they are very nice  they are not too strict  they however are very strict when it comes to drug use on campus i turned my financial aid in january  but apparently was missing something i didn t find out until the day before the final deadline the dorms are nice  if you want something more spacious choose the south side  all girls side   if you want something that is still spacious but all so a bit crowded then choose the north side  co ed  the campus is very strict about rules and regulationsi stay on campus  so i have no idea what off campus housing is like  but from what i hear you have more freedom  plus  you can live by yourself and having a random roommate sucks  you need to room with someone you know in a dorm  or else you re better off staying in an apartment solo there are a few places within walking distance  but it is either a pizza or chicken joint i haven t gone to too many parties this year  but typically if a fraternity or sorority is involved i hear the parties are good in my year at school i have witnessed anyone really getting in to trouble for alcohol or drugs  you usually see in the school paper that someone has been charged or arrested for possession  but it s not like it happens everyday apply as early as possible  the sooner you apply the better off you will be to get the aid you need the food is usually tasty  but sometimes there isn t much variety  the best way to use your dining dollars is to buy some food for the weekend  especially if you re meal plan doesn t allow you to eat in the cafe on the weekends  if you just eat in the cafe all week  and buy a couple of meals for the weekend it ll help you save money the dorms are a very great option  they give you an opportunity to meet a lot of new people  and there are plenty of events to help you meet those who are similar to you in character  it s costly for the newer dorms  but if you aren t worried about being in one of the newly built dorms the cost is not too bad the housing at uta is great quality wise  its just the cost of living there is so high  i don t understand how people can pay for them while being a full time student  they range from      to      a month  that is way out of my budget zone  if i could i would live in the apartments in a heart beat but i just can t afford it the costs on campus are really high  some people can pay for it but others still have to break a limb and give an arm and a leg just have one meal  it could lower some because we are college students and our funds are very limited it is very reasonable  they aren t over and beyond in most parts of the schools but there are some parts of the school that try and treat people like they are still high school students instead of grown adults getting their education i don t really go to parties  it s not that i don t like parties because some are okay but i would rather sit back and have an awesome movie night instead i don t get any money from the school itself but i get state money from my fafsa  i got accepted later in the year and by the time i got accepted they were done giving out money even though i was a transferring honor student from phi thetta  even though i worked really hard this year and got into the honor society organization i am still recieving no money from the school itself and because i have to have my parents tax information the money i was getting that got me by decreased  i m am going to have to work alot harder or i may end up having to transfer to another school where i can get in and do better financially at  which is the last thing i want to do  because i really like uta it could be better  especially in the cafe area and in the area with the different fast food places  some places don t cook their food long enough or it is left out to long and is stale or soggy a few of the dormitories are priced well but they are the older buildings and they don t have the new renovations  the other dormitories that are newer are way more expensive and are like high end apartments very diverse and many new events my experience once in the school of social work was great  i met great people and the professors for the most part love what they do and transmit that to the students uta offers great orientation if you re coming in straight from high school  but if you are a transfer it is very confusing i have been to the mac and it is really nice facility to work out in off campus dining is pretty good  there s a lot of variety when it comes to cuisine and prices are fair the school is actually pretty lenient when it comes to student social lives my financial aid experience was horrible  uta financials department is very rude and uncooperative  they do not keep you informed or give you any advising on how to go about financial aid uta campus has a great variety of food all around  which is greatly appreciated i live on campus  so therefore i m not that familiar with off campus housing  i love living on campus i wish some places would consider student discounts  however it s not too expensive the campus enforces policies as they see necessary  and are pretty strict when it comes to parking for sure  but i don t think they are too strict or too lenient if you re wanting to party  it s not hard to find out where the party is  there is generally always something going on and everyone is generally always invited i feel like the process is easy  and just a matter of filling out the application  however  you do have to look early for application deadlines because it s important you apply for financial aid and scholarships on time i love all of the food on campus and the fact that there is plenty of variety to choose from i live in the lofts apartments and i absolutely love them  i have a roommate  and i love the availability of privacy when needed ultimately  i played volleyball at uta for one semester  but i major in nursing  so i had to choose between the two  lastly  i feel like ever since uta lost dropped its football program everything that is revolved around athletics is just about average  i mean  without football  some people don t even know where you re located much less if you even exist this would get an overall average rating and review from me  i never had anyone go out of their way to help me find off campus housing options  but i have never had any serious issues when it came to searching and finding convenient housing options off campus  as long as you have a smart phone  know how to work the internet specifically google  and know at least two people that also attend uta than you are at a way better advantage than most people i really don t have much to say about the campus strictness at uta because i have never lived on campus to know about the issues with noise  alcohol  partying  dorm visiting  and protesting  i can say i know that parking is quite strict and you can almost bet that if you park in one of the lots without a parking permit sticker  with a permit sticker but park the car in the opposite direction facing traffic  or parking in the faculty parking lot or in a parking spot that is intended for university affiliates only than you will come out of that situation with a ticket  which range between         depending on the severity of the parking violation committed  lastly  when it comes to attendance i would say that uta is pretty average when it comes to the professors requiring attendance and it really just depends on which professor you re taking because they re all different when it comes to financial aid  i would say that the overall process that takes places when you re filling out your fafsa for any university is going to naturally be a strenuous  frustrating process  unfortunately  for uta i never really experienced a lot of problems when it came to receiving the adequate amount of funds i estimated that i would need to survive  other than the simple fact of having to remember every year when it was time to either renew or file a new fafsa for that year  i have always been fortunate to have enough aid given to me that took care of everything  as well as receiving a refund of whatever was leftover  so that truly helped when it came to buying my books  having to buy a laptop in the beginning  and getting all of the basic school supplies bought that eventually would always add up to costing more than what it seemed  uta is known for having a very reasonable and lower cost of tuition and fees verses other schools in texas  and they really are affordable for the education that i am wanting to complete i would have to say that the overall food and dining options on campus are pretty well balanced and provide a pretty good variety of options when it comes to choosing what you want to eat  i especially love a few things about the food options on campus  they have at least  to my present knowledge    different starbucks locations within the dining building  they have a lot of my ultimate favorite food genres  like chik fil a  panda express  yum    subway  and the absolute best one there  sushi  the campus has a huge building that consists of their main dining hall holding those major food places mentioned  along with some convenient vending machines located in almost every building on campus and some snack bars  one of my favorites is the mini convenient store that they have located in one of the buildings  which this places carries everything from any food that can be categorized as junk food  healthy snacks  a wide variety of drinks to choose from  small sized convenient foods that which can be microwaved  like to go soup  mac n cheese over stovetop or microwave  to many more options that are perfect for people that live on campus in a dorm  on the other side of the store  they usually have pre cooked meals that are hot n ready to go when you re in a rush during your lunch break in between classes and switch up the options to choose from for breakfast  lunch  and dinner  which are really super yummy  they also give you the option to make a bagel  grab a muffin  choose from yogurt  sushi  juices  and assortments of fruit  lastly  they have fresh brewed coffee more morning goers or for the people who require coffee at all hours of the day and a pretty awesome cappuccino machine  in regards to places available that aren t essentially located inside a building  uta also has a major road that is lined with different restaurants  fun sporty bars  and sweet little local food joints that you can utilize as a hangout place with your colleagues the mac always has machines available lots of good food on cooper st  haven t really been to many partiesit was an easy process and i received enough to cover my tuition and booksthe connection cafe is not very good but the new restaurant la blue casa is delicious  the campus is great and there are a lot of friendly people our greek life is one of the biggest things on campus as well i think the sports are a really big thing at our school  even though we don t have a football team  we still show spirit through other sports such as basketball  wheelchair basketball  cheerleading and intramurals i m pretty satisfied with the off campus dining  they have a wide variety of ethnical foods and fast foods i think our school s rules are fairly strict  very reasonable i m not really a party person  but it is nice to see friends get together and interact if you do fafsa on time you will usually have no problem getting money there s plenty of options to eat on campus  but not places i prefer  but  there are many places of walking distance that are very good hardly ever see or hear about any problems at schoolnot much input help from financial aid officei stayed at the southeast campus of tarrant county college  which is located in southeast arlington  the city of arlington is a large area  and so off campus dining comes with many diverse options students who do not have parking passes will receive a fine  campus police make rounds around the parking lot and ensure that all vehicles have a pass  one issue that i have found regarding the visitors  parking lot is that the area is completely packed  and the lot recently expanded tarrant county college district was  by far  the best decision for my education  i enjoy the instructors  who take a hands on approach to teaching  as well as the building itself  recently  the schools added lounge areas throughout the institutions that make studying easier when waiting for class to begin  i did not live on the campus  however  i was pleased to have the ability to stay with my parents and focus on striking a balance between a full time education and a full time job  i strongly recommend any high school student to consider beginning their degrees at a local community college  so that they may attend a great institution at a more affordable price the cost can add up  but many restaurants around the campus allow for a discount with a student id the subjects that need strictness are the ones that are the most strict  the parking could be a little more lenient  as tickets for parking in a way that allows the students to get out easier  is not needed i was able to receive financial aid last semester and this semester quite smoothly  but for the next year it has been more difficult  make sure you fill out the fafsa there s quite a variety of food to choose from so you re not bored with the same meal everyday  the price can become quite high if food is bought on restaurants on campus everyday  the environment is very friendly which allows for good eating i lived off campus for some time in an apartment  you had to beat the city traffic and the area was just oki have been to many restarurants off campus but not many are conveneiently located  it tsakes at least    minutes to get anywhere decent i don t think theyre too strict here  i think laws should be upheld as it can be dangerous on this campus i don t party but there s not much going on campus for me and though i would be interested in some fun  there s way too many bad things that happen at night on campus  this is not a party school   i have treated it as a commuter school  i come only for classes and leave immediately after i applied for only scholarships with gooldsby leadership academy and federal student aid  i have heard very little about good financial scholarship options at my school i have given up eating on campus  i would rather drive to find the same or better food for much cheaper the dorms range from decent to nice  all are expensivei live off campus and it s great so much better than a dorm  i get my own room and bathroom and have pretty much complete freedom i usually eat off campus and there are some great places  you just have to drive to them i feel like the campus is just as strict as any other campus filling out fafsa is a pain and the financial aid office is always busy when you try to call the food options they offer like panda express  subway  and chick fil a are awesome because these are some of my favorite places to eat  i often eat one of them between my classes for lunch i live in an off campus apartment that is down the street from the campus  it is vey convenient because i can walk to all my classes and avoid paying for parking registration  being so close to the campus allows for me to go to many different activities and events that are on campus that i would miss out on if i lived farther away and would have to commute  my apartment is very nice and includes various amenities the food is good  although i do consider the meal plan to be quite expensive its overall not that bad  i love pie five the pizza place  the dining dollars i m happy with etci love the campus  its big and diverse  everyone is friendlycontacting special departments can be difficult at this school  but the classes online and the layout of are really good uta is the most diverse school i ve been to  and it adds some uniqueness to it  apart from their excellent academics  they have plenty of extra curricular activities to be a part of  it is an honor to be a maverick very great school  always expanding to create new opportunities for different students  lots to eat in the area and dorm rooms are always availableeveryone here is so nice  the campus is absolutely beautiful  there is always some event going on  with something to do beautiful campus   i m about to start this fall as a sophomore    can t wait ti get started   wonderful councilors and help from all the staff   i was worried that i would or could get lost in registration   but it was pretty straight forward and with the help of the staff it did not take anytime at all uta was not originally my first choice but after joining i came to like it quite a lot  the campus is actually quite large but the main areas of focus are very near that it doesn t feel that big  it is known for it s diverse student population and has quite an active campus i loved it so much  everyone is so nice  little no to parties  there is never a dull moment on campus the community  staff and students  are very friendly and the environment is kind of clean and very welcoming  aside from the many constructions currently being operated  the school life is very calming and peaceful the university of texas  at arlington  is a very good college  the first thing that stands out at uta is the diversity of the students and teachers  so many people  cultures and backgrounds exist here and get along comfortably  the campus environment is very open to its freshmen  with many clubs  groups and general people friendly to new people regardless of pedigree  several teachers at uta have already presented themselves as possessing open insight and clear knowledge  it has been refreshing to see college teachers with unique and effective teaching skills combined with realistic outlooks on student ability  out of class there are many organizations to put ones time too  plus a decently outfitted rec center where one can focus on things other than class  the school itself provides a good balance between effective academics and places to decompress  a real students school love the friendly enviroment  the students and faculty are great to students and will help you in the right direction i am a transfers student  and the transferring process went very smooth  the academic team are all very nice and they keep you up to date with everything you have to do for everything to go as easy as possible i am finding the transition to be very difficult  because of that my gpa has suffered  this will be my third semester and i plan pn it being a much better onr  i am hoping to get my gpa back up to     i like the classes and the living options  it s more of a commuter college so if you want to party and go to a lot of events this is not the school for you but overall it s a great school with many helpful resourcesuta is mostly composed of commuter students so there is not a strong sense of school community or school spirit  if that does not matter to you and you intend to focus on your studies rather than parties or sports  then this school might be a good fit  if you re looking for a sense of community you will most likely not find that here  the academics at uta are very good and there are many amazing professors in all subject areas  the campus is lovely and tuition is very affordable the university of texas at arlington is a school that has a diverse staff and student community  nnthe students are courteous and give a helping hand when one needs it  there is plenty of support for students whenever they are facing obstacles or difficult personal situations  nnthe professors are helpful and there when you need them  some of our adjunct professors are extremely passionate about what they teach and they bring in industry experience to the classroom and teach the students applicable material in addition to the curriculum of the courses from the school   nnthe environment is friendly  comforting  and competitive  it pushes us as students to be and do our best at all times you have to be prepared to do a lot of self teaching at this school   the professors read off of the powerpoint presentation the entire time  read your text books and quiz yourself  you ll definitely learn how to study at this school i absolutely love uta  they have many older instructors with years of experience  they have a variety of programs and the campus is diverse  i feel that i am receiving the best academically  the tuition is affordable and it is one of the largest universities in texas  not only do they offer on campus programs but you can also do programs on line no matter where you live in the state or country  online programs provide coaches to help you daily if needed and you also have an instructor  technical support available anytime  the only thing i can say is that it can be annoying having to wait   hrs for a response via email if you need help because you can t call  other than that it has been an awesome experience and i would recommend this school to everyone  nursing students should not hesitate  go for it it s such a great university to attend  the professors are very helpful and the services the university offers are helpful   beneficial for students  the only thing i would change is the parking  it s so far away i currently attend university of arlington it is a great school i m in the online program and teachers are super nice they have staff there to help you every step of the way form start which is applying for a program to graduation ive loved uta so far it has been an amazing campus and i couldn t expect anything else from a campusi have looked into it and there is a bit of varietythere is a mall a few minutes from campus and if you drive out a bit further you can usually find something that will suit your needsthey do what they believe is besti had a pleasant experience  all questions i had were always answeredi find that there is plenty for me to choose from  however it is a bit expensivei do not stay on campus  but it looks great and my friends are very satisfied with their dormsoff campus housing is very convenient if you want more privacygreat variety of options and great pricefinancial aid process was very easy  staff are great at helping through the entire processthe best parties happen within the sororities and fraternities  they are the bestdorms are great  very satisfied with my housing environment so fari m working on a b a  that was recently created and will be one of the first people to graduate with this degree every professor i ve had has been very passionate about their work it s not the best  but it s cheap and it s okay  which fits for college students there s some sense of strictness and it keeps everyone in check for the most part i feel like scholarships should be easier to get and should offer more money there s not really a party scene  unless you re involved in greek life it s not the best food  but it s still food and i need to eat some dorms are great  but other ones could use a renovation  i feel like many of the dorms that offer rooms with two occupants could have larger rooms  just so there s a little more room  the dorm i live in has thin walls  so maybe thicker walls would be something to consider  price wise  dorms are affordable in most cases off campus housing is relatively expensive and not worth the money  incredibly ghetto everywherethey take advantage of students by ticketing them for every possible offense they can come up with it is incredibly hard to qualify for any aid at this school and they charge a ridiculous amount of fees to extort more and more money from students i dont participate too much in partying but there are celebrations quite frequently there are a lot of different choices for food in both the university center and the surrounding area it is really expensive to live on campus and the dorms arents even worth the money it cost to live in them i got a legit scholarshipthere is a lot of weed smoking in arlington hallthey have all of the optionslots of variety  but very expensive food in this town is very good they have very specific rules  especially in the dorms  as long as you don t go out of your way to break them though  don t worry too mcuh got great scholarships  looking for more now not a lot of parties  like    at all the cafe is aweful  however  pie five seems to counterract it with awesome pizza  totaly recomend getting the meal plan with the most college park dollars i live in kc hall  the rooms and amenities are great  however  there are very few washing machines  these are almost always the cause of community strife  other than that  the rooms and facilities are amazing off campus dining is a must  since there is a small variety on campus the administrations are very kind and helpful most of the time i got my fafsa amount  some more scholarship options are needed not much diversity  but it s okay on the wallet they are pretty pricey but a good distance from the school the popular places closed down  so there isn t much of a variety now they re strict when it comes to parties  but they are pretty much fully aware of whats going on and they are always passing by the schooli would say  apply for scholarships also because everything added up together could get expensivemost parties are in the on campus apartments or organizations give them at different places around the areathe cafeteria food is okay on certain days  the best places to go to are the on campus restaurants and the places that are located in college parkeverything is nice and within the same area of the school which is pretty coolif i do go out to eat  it s usally at one of these restaurants  cooper street and parks mall offers a huge variety of eating i haven t any run ins with the uta police  however  they are very strict on parking  do not park in the teacher s parking lots or you will get a ticket although i am still leary about using student loans  uta was great about providing the funds i need to complete my graduate degree as a commuter student  i don t have a lot of time to attend campus parties  however  before i graduate i have a goal to attend a homecoming bash   it looks like so much fun every time i have eaten there  it has been good  however  i am a broke college student   i can t really afford to go out to eat all of the time  so  i don t eat there as often as i would like i love the graduate program way more than uta s undergraduate program  the classes are smaller so the students are more likely to know each other  it creates a more comfortable learning atmosphere compared to     students who don t talk i ve had no issue with adminit was easy to applyi don t really  attend campus partiesi think the variety is good it s about average compared to other schools i ve seeni personally don t care much about sports but i appreciate the work put into the sports programs at ut arlington i have lived in arlington for most of my life  i enjoy it  i like the fact that many friends and family are within an hour and a half from arlington many students are busy with their social life and their needs that they have no desire to give in a friendship  i would be willing to be their friend if they had any desire to be mine i definitely plan on doing an internship  i have to have observation hours for my major  i am really not sure how to accomplish this goal as of yet but i plan on talking to my advisor i have not experienced the strictness or leniency of the dorms  therefore it is difficult to give it a true rating i had struggles because of my parents challenges and complications with taxes  it has been such a hassle that i was unable to receive any financial aid i live in a house owned by my church and backed by a student organization  i love living there just apply through fafsa  fairly easy process  students will receive the aid needed campus really follows school s honor code  i love the fact that nobody can smoke in public  really big pro for coming here dorms could be better than expected  everyone is so friendly and sociable  teachers are great  cost is the same for any ut system schools  a bit more expensive for on campus students  housing process is fairly easy  all incoming freshmans will be scared and will think it s scary  but it really isn t getting into my program is fairly easy  i encountered no challenges  most important would maybe be grades and gpa our campus has a really secure campus and it makes you feel safe this campus is safe and secure  there are some issues going on such as theft  and assault  however  the police and special security agents do their best to keep everyone safe and resolve issues  they have a system of sending bulletin emails about any issue taken place right away to alert everyone on campus  i feel pretty safe on campus even if it is an open campus  the students here are pretty good   we can trust them with our belongings if we left it for few minutes  they keep an eye on our stuff  since it is an open campus  people who do not belong to campus are the ones who create issues  but the cops are pretty quick to catch them many people are really involved  but sports are not my thing it s is convenient to live on campus but they always fill up so easily  hence most of the students commute  i have looked around to move in on campus apartments but they are expensive  it is easier to stay away and in our comfortable place of our choice than moving in here  the space is alright but the overall look of buildings aren t so great  depending on the location of apartments  some are safe and some are not  social atmosphere isn t bad plus we get to meet a lot more people from the university  distance wise it is pretty convenient         minutes walk and you reach the university i did not apply for financial aid so i cannot really comment on that  however  i have heard from some students that it is a bit of a hassle but they received the financial aid they needed the greek life here is pretty average  there s not much going on since most of the students here don t live on campus and commute  but their parties are fun and they try to raise funds and make changes on campus in their small ways  the non greeks look at greek students indifferently  and vice verca  however  the greek students do encourage non greeks to join their fraternities very good places to eat off campus for those with a car living off campus is very expensive and far from school especially for students with no car  parking wouldn t be worth it for students living off campus because there is hardly anywhere to park unless you want to pay about     for that day party scene is fun here  nothing bad has happened the food at the market is ridiculously expensive  but at least it s nearby if you re in a pinch there are people from all backgrounds at school and there doesn t seem to be any animosity between groups i like being an art major  guidance is easy to come by and class sizes are small for studio work it wasn t bad at all  for art  you aren t required to submit a portfolio until you ve taken a few classes  so it s nice to have some guidance in that sense i m getting a teaching certification  so i will be student teaching eventually  it seems like a pretty easy process and internships for other options are good good professors  some interesting class options  i m an art major and most of the studio classes are small  allowing for individual attention i love being an art major  the teachers are all active in the field and very passionate about their work good options  but they re very spread out  which i guess is a good and bad thing i live in off campus student apartments and i like it  they re really nice and somewhat affordable i ve lived in the arlington area my whole life  great shopping  but some parts of the city are very unsafe the health clinic is pretty good and the police are readily available i met my boyfriend here  it s pretty easy to meet people not too bad  chipotle and potbelly are within walking distance  mcdonald s and wendy s are also i don t party so i don t know i m not greek so i don t know i wish they had more scholarship opportunities for the  average  student  most are based on gpa  organizations  or transfer  they re hard to get i toured some apartments and there are only   good communities here  really  the others are old and somewhat trashed  i ended up living off campus i don t know much about the living on campus policies because i live off campus  but everything else is good no football team  but i kind of like that  it keeps the school close knit n a i am an online studentn a i am online studentalright  you can get help we have more restaurants around the campusget to know other cultures i m currently in nursing  and i have to say that the academics are very rigorous but it inspires me even more to become something bigthere is plenty of variety it gets the job done  there is plenty of variety i know that the greek life has events that help support people in the community or the campus  i feel that some non greeks view greeks as people who pretty much buy their own friends during college  people who are rich  or people that like to party there are a lot of places to eat off campus i just feel like the parking is horrible  i feel like the school makes more money from parking tickets than tuition it s very hard to get financial aid and it s not a very transparent process  it s just a very difficult process to find scholarships catering to students at school and its offered to very specific groups i wish there were more options to get around it s definitely a lot better than i thought it would be i don t really care for it that much to be honest i feel pretty safe on campus i don t really party that often or at all to be honest athletic events do not get full mostly because a lot of students who attend are commutersi wouldnt say its the best but it is not the worst  living off campus is a lot cheaper than dorms not to mention the added space and freedom makes it way worth it i really like the engineering program at uta  it is very challenging and time consuming but i feel like i have learned a lot so far and i believe it is prepping me well for when i get a job in this field one good thing about the cops on campus is that if you are ever at school late and would like someone to walk with you to your car  they will be glad to do it all you need to do is call them i do not live on campus so i don t know how strict they are about dorms  however i do know professors are very strict about the honor code but i believe that is at any university there are quite a few things close to uta such as the cowboys at t stadium  the rangers ballpark  six flags as well as a few malls the first couple weeks everyone on campus is really friendly and willing to go out of their way to talk to you  after that everyone gets caught up in there classes and don t seem to venture past their group of friends muchthe food court is pretty good  and the connection cafe is pretty lacking  the college park district is dying left and rightthe sports life on campus is small but the mac is an amazing gym that i m extremely happy that i can use i m not very happy with the financial aid  i receive hazelwood act so they told me they couldn t offer me the pell grant money  fast forward a year and my girlfriend tells me that she receives both and so does everyone she knows  so they screwed me out of money that should have been awarded to me it s the normal fast food options that are everywherei have a shared room in a hall and it s very nice considering a lot of the other rooms on campus  perfect size for one person but your forced to share with someone else  a hall and vandgergriff are probably the best housing situations on campus most of the parties are in the on campus appartmentsnot the biggest greek life on campus but they actively recruit you in the beginning of fall semester the architecture program is pretty good  however it seems like its best days were in the    s  i would definitely recommend it as an undergraduate program i have seen an issue arise the last couple semesters i have attended  usually a frat gets in trouble for underage drinking not the best area of town  the campus is alright but the area around it is alittle sketchy safety and security are very important on campus  staff doesn t leave any stone unturned to prohibit crimes and sexual assault  i feel very safe even at    am when i go to my apartment from library the athletic facilities are good but students do not always participate as they spend most of their time studying  during holidays  most of the students pays attention to sports  of course its not the big part of campus life there are not many apartments and so students have a hard time searching for an apartment  most of the spacious apartments are not close to campus and the apartments close to campus are not spacious  students are adjusting a lot here and sometimes it even affects studies i have this great opportunity of studying at university of texas at arlington  students who graduate from this university have to make little efforts landing a job as the coursework is good and so the students acquire lot of skills in diverse aspect by the time they graduate there are a lot of nice looking women and handsome men on campus  however i can t give the best assessment given that i am married and don t pay much attentioni think the athletics is great  we win a lot of games and i see a lot of team support  however i think the school would get more interest if it had a football team i grew up in the area and i love the atmosphere of the city uta has very strict rules about academic dishonesty  alcohol use  and drug use on campus the area around uta isn t the safest area  but the campus police provide escorting services every day of the week with good hours  especially at night  the police will walk you to your car if needed  in order for you to feel safe on campus  i see campus police driving around or walking around constantly uta is one of the most diverse campuses in the nation and state of texas  so there are tons of restaurants in the area that come from all walks of life  from indian to pakistani to greek to mexican to vietnamese food  you can never go wrong with the restaurants off campus i m not in a sorority but some of my coworkers and friends are in sororities and fraternities and they absolutely love it  it s a pretty big part of campus life but if you don t end up joining greek life none of the people treat you differently or judge you  greek life is very accepting on uta uta has a really good athletic training kinesiology degree program  and uta also has one of the best nursing programs in the state  and that is my fall back plan if i don t end up continuing in the at kines major  all of the faculty are very knowledgeable and have great experience in the fields of work i m not really a big partier  but i have a lot of sorority and fraternity friends who host parties often  i ve attended a few and they re pretty fun sports are pretty big at uta and i typically attend all of the games and sporting events i can  although  there isn t a football team and that is what the university is really lacking  but maybe in the next     years there will be one  but ultimately  i love uta and the sports and teams  it s like one big family over all i absolutely love uta  it was one of my top choices in schools  both of my parents are alumni and my mom works on campus in the college of education  so my parents love the school as well  the sports atmosphere is awesome and everyone really gets into the volleyball  basketball  softball  and baseball games  although  i really wish there was a football team  but hands down i love the cost of tuition and the faculty is really awesome on campus  they love to be hands on and give you any kind of help or resources you need its a suburban city so if you re into that  its a great citynot bad if you re yearning for freedomdepending n how much you are willing to pay  the off campus housing will help you accordingly im sure its great i just haven t gotten around it yeti think ut arlington views varsity sports as an option for those who are interested i did not have any problem with it at all nursing is one the main majors there so it has a lot of attention  since it is one of best nursing schools  the program is really difficult to get in and they expect a lot out of you there not really there but i haven t herd of any polices affecting parties or lives class sizes are to big and crowded but at the middle of the semester nobody showed up to class  professors are like anywhere else  there are some good ones and bad ones there is a lot of attractions around there like  flags  cowboys stadium  the rangers stadium and parks mall right next to each other uta is somewhat sheltered from the arlington area there are plenty of restaurants in the area i am not in greek life  but many of my friends are and most of the people do not fit the typical greek stereotype the parties are safe and well organizedthe administration take the safety of the students and staff very seriously i really enjoy ut arlington although we don t have football  the sports we do have are enjoyable  we also have an indoor rockwall i don t do greek but i have quite a few friends who do we are located in the middle of  city  bad things occasionally happen lots of places to find some good food i dont live off campus  but the apartments are abundant and close it s not bad but you realy need to pay attention to the cost relative to what you are getting it s an average school  filled with average bureaucracy it is located in the dallas ft  worth metroplex which is one of the most entertaining spots in texas i am just starting my ee degree program  and it is very interesting because they are  revamping the system  to keep it up to date overall this has been a new experience for me and has taught me a lot about making that transition from a high school student to all on your own college student  my mentality has changed a lot  i am now more focused in my education it is not bad at all  sometimes the dining options close a tad earlier sometimes but otherwise plenty to choose from and satisfying options it is a bad experience and very costly  my fasfa never went through because of the formatting but they informed me after i approached them the first day to move in and i had sent it since before my summer they are students just like us and they don t want anything mischievous going on and noise to be kept at a minimum during sleeping hours i love living on campus  it has taught me new experiences i had never had before  occasionally  the people above us would decide to stomp on the ground but other than that it was great it is okay  i am more into studying to get good grades for my classes and therefore i do not have the time to party one of my classmates lives in the apartments by uta and so far he loves it there we have highly competitive teams and club organizations that really make the students feel apart of them i feel generally safe in and around campus  i do not feel as if anyone would be in any danger walking by themselves there is a wide variety of restaurants to go to at all times of the day  and they are all convenient there is always something fun and interesting to do  both on and off campus i love my on campus apartment  it is very nice and clean  also  it came with all of the amenities that i desired while the prices may be great  the quality is terrible  most off campus housing looks old and run down the financial aid that the school gave me only covered half of what i needed it to  it wasn t too difficult to apply for though uta does not have a football team and in texas  football is a big thing  for this campus  basketball is the biggest sport and not many people care to mention anything about games  sporting events is one of the least significant things on campus i love the psychology program at uta  there are always new ways to get involved in studies and research done by other students  and this has always interested me while more often than not  there are always campus officers around  there should be more emergency telephones located around campus  in the center of the campus  there are plenty of phones  however  i live on the edge of campus and there are no telephones in sight i love how uta really pushes to get all students involved around campus  however  the focus is mainly on fun and not about going to class  the majority of students do not attend class and their grades suffer because of it  i believe that if they were more strict on attendance  students would be more responsible when it comes to going to class and getting their work done  after all  we are here for a better education mae is a difficult but helpful program if you do the correct things  you re fine the general health in the campus is quite high they give parking tickets like halloween candy and condoms i grew up in the area  it isnt new york  but its way better than lubbock mostly chain restaurants and fast food  but there are a good places to eat farther from campus i grew up in the area and i know it well  so i feel safe on campus and the surrounding area get the hell out of here if you want to  arlington is a city to be only available for old people it s great for a small college of political science  i would not recommend the graduate program though it your average everyday university police  the parking police however have gotten tougher not the best in the nation  but very safe if your worried about anything every shops that pop up around the area gets closed down  the school is really nice most of the faculty is pretty helpful and even though there isn t a football team  there is a good amount of school spirit  the school has a lot of diversity and between greek life and student organizations i found it really easy to meet great people the population here at uta is very diverse  both professors and students  my favorite part of the campus is the mac  maverick activity center   the center includes a huge gym which would be covered under your tuition  they offer a lot of fun activities and intramural sports students can get involved in  which would include rock climbing as well the university of texas at arlington offers multiple areas of study  a rigorous curriculum  numerous resources  and dedicated professors  i have experienced excellent service by advisors  as they have all done whatever is necessary to assist me in my education progression  the education i have received thus far will allow for added expertise in my field once i graduate  i am extremely pleased with the quality of my education my freshman year at uta was very memorable and i made some lifelong friends  it is scary for the first two weeks but there are so many people who can help you with your questions so that you wont feel lost  and i attended a lot of parties while balancing my academics and i never felt out of place  wherever i would go next i would make new friends  the food is amazing in terms of choices and you have starbucks there so yeah a pretty good start for the day  the night life around the campus is good  there are a lot of restaurants and the mall is a    min drive  the campus os beautiful and everyday there is some new thing going on  so yeah my freshman i was at my top point overall this school is pretty great  however  i think placing more emphasis on creating bonds between commuter students will really help with the lacking school spirit  whether that s by placing more emphasis on our sports teams  or various clubs that don t hold meetings in the evening when majority of the students have gone home  while the faculty and resources can give a school recognition  school spirit increases student drive to attend a university and be a proud student  i do not regret my decision to come here and will be a proud graduate  however i do feel this school is a constant work in progress the school is average in every sense  there are only   good  dorms  there is no football team and therefore limited school spirit  it s a commuter school so make of that what you will  there s not much to do around in arlington but it is not a college town either  classes are relatively easy if you come from a competitive climate i would say that my overall experience with the university of texas at arlington was satisfactory  i loved the atmosphere  but the campus needs a little work  i agree with my fellow classmates that there should be an update in the layout and structure of the school  i would change the design of the buildings and how they handle campus security and safety  as there were multiple crimes throughout each semester of my attendance  with the school being most recognized for their nursing and engineering programs  i would highly recommend this university to peers who are interested in those two career paths  the university of texas at arlington is reputable in many other areas as well  overall  i enjoyed my time at the university because i was able to create lasting memories and everyone seems to be so welcoming great school with a lot of resources for specific majors only  strong in engineering  mathematics  and architecture  nthe university has great diversity  great peers  and a great lively group of friendly students  honestly  love the school even with its simple flaws great university at very affordable tuition rates   uta is a very good return on investment based on surveys provided by payscale comonce i went to the fieldtrip to uta it seemed very great  the students there were very applicable to what they were doing  i also  believe that school is very great  because it has all of the things it nedds to succeed this university has the best engineering programs to do while being close to home and many career paths to choose from very moderate climate that allows good chances to excel academically  freedom of choice is present on campus in my opinion  the university of texas at arlington is a special place  there are people from all over the nation and world so there is plenty of diversity  also  the students and staff members for the most part are kind and great to know  here is a great place for anyone to build long lasting relationships while getting a quality education in whatever degree you pursue  from the people  to the academics  to the athletics  i recommended at least considering it i love the diversity at uta  but i almost feel like i don t get the help i need to plan ahead  i m going to go to graduate school  but i do not understand how i am gonna get there or anything excellent school to finish your   year degree  excellent way to take online classes  all of the instructors are very helpful so far this has been an excellent university  i am doing the online accelerated nursing program and love it  i am able to set the pace and be able to still hold down two jobs and take care of my family  i highly recommend the people at the school are amazing  everyone is so helpful and understanding  only thing i would change is the organization of departments other than engineering and nursing this review is coming from a commuter  one of the worst issues about this university is parking  recently the parking at uta has become an issue due to increased prices for parking permits and the closing down of parking lots for construction  if you care about your education  the professors are willing to help you succeed in any way you can  overall  i ve had a good experience at this university i was a little hesitant before transferring to uta because i did not know very much about this university and its reputation in psychology  my field of study  i was pleasantly surprise about every aspect of this institution  i enjoyed every single one of my classes and the atmosphere is tremendous  i do wish more founding would go towards some buildings other than chemistry and engineering  since those are the main focus of the sponsors  leaving the development of some other buildings unattended  nnuniversity of texas at arlington is not only an excellent institution  it is also quite affordable  which is extremely admirable given the struggle that many students go through when seeking a degree nnthe help i obtained from counselors and teachers was beyond any expectations and definitely shaped my success in my college career  ni successfully attained my bachelor s degree and would highly recommend this university to anyone pursuing a degree there s a cool commuter rewards program  there are some really good professors  most classes use a bunch of technology   th most diverse university i like to go watch some games i love it  it s very convenient i wish i could get more living in an apartment is better parking tickets are pretty common i received enough for the year so i guess that s good study first   party later there are a variety of dining places in college park and they are very accessible i do not live on campus so i cannot describe how its like to live on campus the financial aid office does not help and they just tell you the process but does not help i have never been to party but am pretty sure that they are somewhat fun there is always something to do  there is the entertainment district with many different attractions the campus has security and they rnrnare responsible when crimes are committed and make students feel secure the parking for off campus student is very bad because the availability is very poor administration is not very helpfulclass sizes are average and the professor and student relationship can be helpfulgreeks are always recruiting and doing fundraising events and it helps the society to get involved entering freshman at uta get the best scholarships if not a capped student i think it s average  it s necessary for schools to keep their students in check my friend loves her apartment and pays cheaper rent it s all right but from what i hear  home is best my program is amazing  it has a master degree and bachelor s degree in a   year fast track  unforunately  uta is getting rid of it and i am grandfathered into the program biomedical engineering is a great major but right now it s difficult to find jobs or internships the police is very good about keeping things under control i don t really party all that much though it s honestly all about average  it s not awful but not amazing  some deals are very nice occasionally nursing can be hard but i love it i plan to have an internship in the future many students love the different athletic activities there are many different groups minor fights occur  nothing extraordinarythe ones i know are pretty cool  expensive but provides a lot of funstudent discounts all the way  could be very expensive but the freedom s worth itthe lack of public transport makes it worse the dining experience is pretty nice  there are a lot of different restaurants to choose from and the cost depends on where you go there are a lot of restaurants near by which is really convenient for those students who do not have a car  there aren t many activity places near by that i know of  but the mac has a lot of fun things to do the process was fairly easy and the program was great arlington itself is nice  but the fact that there s no public transportation makes going into the city an adventure in and of itself i loved living on campus but i could get an apartment for the same cost the maverick promise is one of the main reasons i decided to attend uta  there is no hassle as long as you meet the required deadlines i have never had any problems walking alone at night  but i have friends that don t feel safe going out at night if we didn t have to have a meal plan i would like it a lot better i can t wait to rush next semester  greek life is so fun they are super strict about no smoking but alcohol and underage drinking isn t pushed so much the police are always roaming around  but you can only keep a huge campus safe to a point there is a lot of variety but cooper street is so busy its hard to navigate this campus is very safe minus a few issues  the only problem we really had last year were people stealing phones i am in a sorority and i enjoy it a lot  we don t haze at all and everyone is welcome to join it s fun  but as a college student who is broke you can t really enjoy a lt of the activities available to those who are already in the working world i had to go into the financial aid office on numerous occasions to make sure everything i turned in would go through  it took a long time for it to take effect  and i ended up having to pay for the majority of my classes on my own due to time constraints there is a fair amount of protection security and police presence on campus  also  alerts are sent to my phone and email about recent incidences i do not know much about the greek life at my school there s always something going on for students here on campus  most of the time  it s free of charge the sports here are fantastic  we have a little bit of everything  except for a varsity football team  marching band is wonderful  and school spirit is astonishing we have numerous fast food restaurants as well as sit down dining establishments  many of these stores offer either discounts or occasional events for uta students the off campus housing is fantastic  it s quite close to various retail stores and they re right around the corner from convenience stores  they still are within walking distance of campus  plus they re beautiful buildings thank to my professor i had access to a great professional internship  i believe they are a great way to step into the real world and gain experience  i highly encourage students to apply for internship and gain the lifetime experience  workers are usually lenient knowing that you are a student and willing to work around your schedule  sometimes it may not be the best or dream internship you were looking for  but it definitely opens door for better opportunities i was in the business department  management   i had a great experience because of the support i received from my professors  they are willing to help and guide students to take the right steps  i wish if there was an option for bachelors with concentration in hr  however after i joined shrm i learned tremendous information about hr  management and fully enjoyed my last year of undergraduate  i highly recommend keeping professors who have real life experience then those who teach from books  student like me who are visual and verbal learn from experience not books  the facilities for student groups can be improved by providing space and better offices to have meetings and events there are more options for vegetariansthe students are helpful however when it s busy you are not given all the attentioni believe our basketball team is fabulous it s great however it can be better specially in the evening  many students take night classes and i highly recommend having more officers at night doesn t apply because i was not part of iti did not live on campus if you are involved in many organizations the parties are fun and entertaining otherwise you can feel lost i don t exactly know what is greek life  i live in in campus apartment i feel proud that i choose thisi like my school and campusi am not that party person the financial aid office makes it so easy for the students  they even have a facebook and a twitter account for more information some greeks do great things for out community  greek life is not as important to many people on campus there is a lot of school spirit  sports don t seem to be too important to most students on campus athletics are a big part of the school as many students take part of it  however  my school isn t a big school like baylor  and our school teams are very mediocre so there s not a lot of student support for the sports teams campus is not very strict about a lot of things  the only thing their pretty strict about that i know of is hazing within the greek life i live with my parents  the pros are i save money from having to pay rent  i always have homemade cooking  and i don t have to pay for utilities  the cons are  not a lot of independence  and its a    min trip to campus without traffic there are lots of off campus dining spots for a student to choose from and most of them offer student discounts there s lots to do on campus in regards to recreation  lots of clubs and activities to take part in  outside campus there isn t much to do  a lot of restaurants though greek life is very  meh   no one really cares for it  there are those who want to be a part of it and those who don t  either way no one really makes a big deal of whether or not you join  housing is separate and can be found in a specific area i received financial aid the first year i attended university  the second year  i was not awarded any because my efc was too high best parties take place at greek life  and they have a positive impact on student experience i do not live in campus  i live about    minutes away from the collegei will not be living in campus  i will be commuting from home i have no idea as this is going to be my first semester at utai will enjoy being in this program  the classes are not that big  therefore i get to be closer to my instructors the advisor for my program was very helpful  he explained me what classes i still need to take and how long the process is going to be there is not much variety of restaurants and attractions options off campuswhe i went to orientation they talked about the safety of the school again  i do not live in campus nor i have attended there yet  this will be my first semester at uta i commute to school every day  therefore i don t know that much about the off campus housing i am about to start as a student at ut arlington this upcoming semester  when i went to the orientation  i noticed that athletics was s big deal for the college i prefer to live off campus  there is just more freedom that comes with living off campus  not to mention it gives you a sense of having your own home i m not much or a partier  so i m not really sure  others say they enjoy it though i came from a very small town  so there are so many more people than what i am used to  there are many places to go out and have a good time  but there are also places that are better for some down time  it s great because if you want to go out and do something there will always be something to do  but if not you can stay at home and relax medicine is great at uta  it s great to learn new things daily  facilities are decent and the workload may be heavy at times  opportunities are never ending when you re willing to take them staff on the campus seem to enjoy what they do  making it easier for students on or off campus feel comfortable talking to them about any issues they may have there are many people of various ethnicities studies in visual communications are excellent there is a decent number of available study labs there is a satisfactory variety of diners there are a variety of internships available the professors are helpful and engaging there are moderately frequent reports of crime the school s support of campus teams is vocal be sure to apply for financial aid early safe drinking practices are encouraged there is a good variety of malls and restaurants housing is good  but prices could be improved greek life is interactive and very involved do not park without a permit   it will cost you   no drinking or smoking allowed on campus but hard to enforce the drinking part i commute so i have very little knowledge of campus housing except that there is a wide range of choices  especially price wise lots of bars in walking distance with great prices   some have music on weekends   also levitt pavilion in the summer has   shows a week in an outdoor venue so many ethnic groups represented   lgbt s are a norm in classes  etc   very accepting of everyone one of the few schools that offer the mla program   lots of activities around this program it is a typical university atmosphere dedicated area for the greek houses   a big commuter school so not so much emphasis on campus actitivities basically like a city   lots of variety food is not the best but certainly not the worst   has some chains in different buildings that makes it easier for those not near the student center   about to complete a huge renovation so expecting it to be even better very soon very close to texas rangers ballpark and cowboy stadium   great access to both dallas and fort worth which have everything you could ever look for including cultural events  museums  night life  incredible eating opportunities and parks   only drawback is that public transportation has just started in arlington campus police patrol regularly   there are alarm kiosks that are easily set off if need be modern  up to date equipment and facilities   free to students and good deals for family   has a good variety of classes including yoga  zumba  etc arlington is continuing to expand their downtown experience which is very close to the campus   as it is a suburban area  there are all the chains you want plus many unique restaurants   it also includes a lot of different ethnic choices   a lot of places are in walking distance i simply applied and was accepted after all my necessary paperwork was processed  transcripts are needed and personal information  as long as you speak with a enrollment advisor its an easy process i was able to register with ease  i m taking   week online courses so the workload should be easy to managethis program for a bachelor s in nursing will prepare to find a job at any hospital both magnet status and non magnet status i simply applied for the fafsa and received a pel grant that was processed with the school  no headache so faras this was my another  experience in western culture   previous one was in africa   but the things are best here in texas  as i feeli m assuming its great from what i ve heard  this will be my first semester there are some science majors  not a lot in my particular field though there wasn t any difficulty getting into my major i m a guy so answering this question was a little weird health and safety are an important part of any school i love the diversity of my friends  i m not one to stick with just one race i don t have off campus housing so i m not sure about it the local atmosphere is good  everything is as should be i m not really into partying so i can t answer to that it s okay  not to bad depending on what you like to eat my english teacher was a excellent teacher  they way she taught was different then my other classes  we would move are chairs around in a circle to have a talk about a section of the book we were reading  she was open to every ones thoughts  we did a lot of group work to which i don t normally like but she would give each group a topic and we would have to explain the topic to the class  i learned a lot in her class because i actually was fully aware of what is going on in class  my criminal justices teacher was also like that when he taught  he would stop lecturing and ask us what we thought and if nobody wanted to answer he would just randomly call on people i really didn t like when he did that because most of the time he would call on people he knows the names of like me for example  i have to say that it helped me focus more in class because i never knew if he would call on me the services on campus are pretty fast i would say  when every i go to the library  campus store  information office and even the cafã© i don t have to wait extremely long  the lines aren t super fast considering there is a line when i wait but i never complain the lines are moving at okay pace  the staff working these services are polite and look like they want to be here  they are help when asked a question lots of options to choose from online learning is great  i work full time and have a family to care for   distance learning is the only way i have been able to go back to school just starting  classes are online the guys and girls are friendly for the most part but can usually be a little rude the campus is strict on the right things and lenient on the right things   alcohol  drugs  honor code  safety are all things the school takes very seriously there really is not much that goes on at campus there are many options available on campus   i can not get tired of eating there   it might not be the healthiest but it sure is delicious the scholarship that the school gave me helped me tremendously   even though i still had to pay out of pocket  it was a lot more affordable for me there are so many resources that one can use to help them pass their classes   the professors are great and are willing to help   one can tell that they are passionate about what they teach i still have a lot of work to do in order to be eligible to apply   it is a very competitive field the spirit of the city is very low   besides the ballpark  the stadium and the six flags  there is not much of school spirit or excitement all around it has been an amazing experience so far   i ve learned so much from all of my professors more affordable and convenient than on campus lifenew students hang outs have been builtnew constructed research facilities   campus expansioni rather satisfied with my degree plantoo many thefts and assaultsi m not a greek so i don t really knowvery strict on attendance and honor code no exceptionswe need more food variety that s affordable open mindedness to diverse relationships small with a few exciting things  but not much lots of work  but flexible and interesting very diverse with a variety of schedule options sometimes expensive and not up to par the costs depends on where you go really  i usually take my car to drive to off campus restaurants just because it is a far walk from the campus itself  costs varies depending on whether you want healthy or unhealthy food  it s convenient when you re tired of eating at the food court on campus  some places near school give student discounts like golden chick   that s all i could think of  the best place to check out would be smiling moose  that place has very delicious sandwiches  the only thing is that it s kind of expensive for lunch we don t have a football team so there aren t really any friday nights celebrations  we do have a baseball  volleyball  tennis  wheelchair basketball team  it gets exciting depending on which sports you like  our school spirit is mediocre  the athletic facilities are actually pretty amazing  one of the best that i ve been to around here  it s called the mac at our school and a lot of people go there to socialize and work out if you take the classes you re advised to take you wont graduate on time  learn your degree plan yourself  the people in your major s department don t help you the mac is absolutely wonderful  top notch equipment  plenty of room  swimming pool  indoor basketball courts and soccer fields  climbing wall  outdoor court  ping pong  pool  the only complaint i have is that we only have two power cages i see nothing wrong with the facilities here on campus the cafe has good food every once in a while but i wish it had more variety  thank goodness we have the plaza to make up for the cafe s mistakes it s exactly how it s supposed to be  cops are present but not around every corner it s really not worth the trouble  just try to live on campus there are ugly people and there are attractive people  it s just like the rest of the world strictness doesn t control whether or not people actually obey the rules  so it s kind of useless not much to say  they re around  they throw good parties every once in a while i did dual credit in high school  giving me college credit before actually going to college  i had to go in three different times and tell them that i was an incoming freshman and not a transfer student  afterwards i found out i did not receive the freshman scholarship i wanted because they mistook me for a transfer student yet again  i went in to correct them once again and ended up receiving the scholarship  it was a hassle but in the end it was worth it  no other school this cheap has scholarships this high not a lot to do on the weekends but weekdays are fun nothing really note worthy about the campus facilities  they seem pretty standard i enjoy being in the art program  the people are interesting as are the teachers  most classes are workshops made for students to work on projects and they give plenty of time to work on them while uta isn t the best school ever  it s full of the best people and teachers i have ever had the pleasure to know  i m glad i chose to come here instead of some other school most off campus dining is fast food  cheap but good the campus is self reliant but there s plenty to do variety of cultures and fashion here being an art major at school can be challenging but overall it s great  the teachers are really helpful and the workload  while tiring at times  never feels too overwhelming registering is pretty easy and the classes offered are very good the health center provided me with plenty of care and help when needed the food around campus was pretty good overall overall my experience at the dorms was positive  however there were some slight issues i had  the heating system was unreliable  being too cold in winter and too hot in summer  moving heavy objects to the upper floors was difficult since there were no elevators  however  the staff and residents were all friendly and helpful  so my issues were few and far between there are plenty of off campus housing to choose from  however  they are either expensive or poor conditions the off campus dining options are limited  there are the typical mcdonald s and other fast food places but that is really it living on campus has been great for me  the dorms are good depending on which dorm you choose to live in and the residents are very nice  the best option for dorms would be the newest dorm building  vandergriff  which was built two years before  the worse option would be lipscomb which is a very old building that has had mold problems in the past  all of the dorms have a amenities and good social atmospheres  the prices are reasonable  you definitely pay for what you get  all of t he dorms are extremely convenient  most of the dorms are in the center of campus or just a little ways off campus strictness is average on my campus the safety and security on campus is the best i have seen  at night  i see police driving around constantly making sure that people are safe  the police even have a once a week dinner in the campus cafe for students to ask questions about anything they would like to know  all of the buildings require a swipe card after hours the only meal plan offered is to the campus cafe and there is a little diversity but the meals are often repeated on weekly bases  the food quality ranges from decent to good depending on which chef is in the kitchen  the value is a little high but it is doable  the meal plan is swipes or you can use dine in dollars to eat in the plaza  you are given a limited amount of dine in dollars depending on which meal plan you purchase  the plaza has good food such as panda express  subway  sushi  and chick fil a  the final opinion to use your dine in dollars is in the market  they sell easy to eat food and school supplies my campus is extremely diverse and completely accepting  we have a wide range of races  sexuality  and religions and no one judges them  there a open clubs for just about anything  there has been a week where christians set up a prayer tent and then the next week muslims are playing prayer music  there have been political stances shown openly on campus where both sides express their opinions  the campus overall is extremely accepting and understandable the academic level at my college is good  the professors are easy to reach and they teach very well  they are easily approachable and are willing to help when a student needs it  the curriculum in most of my classes have been the average information that students learn  the most popular study area for people on campus is the library  it is six floors of great study areas  there are also some good study programs that are available to the students being an education major on my campus is great  there are not many education majors on the campus so it is easy to get to know the advisers  the education professors  and i am not competing against that many students to get into the program  so far the workload has been fairly easy but i am expecting it to get hard as i continue in the program my experience at school has been amazing  i have made amazing friends that i know will be in my life for a long time and have had a lot of fun  my school has room for all sorts of people that you kind find people who are greeks or all the way to the cosplayers and d d nerds  there really is a group of people for everyone to hang out with  i would choose my school again in a heart beat because no matter what there is a place that anyone can fit into the greek life on campus is the main social hub on campus  if you are in a greek house then you know all about the upcoming social events and gossip that floats around campus  the greeks are nice students who do not let the fact that they are greek keep them from socializing with the non greek  the greek students are viewed as the cool kids by the non greeks  the greeks  however  do not have specific housing for them but they do have houses for meetings the teachers and faculty are very nice and helpful  it is very diverse and you have a great opportunity to make friends bachelor of fine arts design program is top notch   i m a rhode island school of design scholarship winner with easy entry into any usa top fine arts schools after getting the ap studio portfolio coveted     uta hires unexpected   top notch working professionals including award winning advertising creatives   they are easy going in class without the portfolio reviews of north texas   but if you work to get the a  you walk out with an impressive original student portfolio that impresses the pros   what you get out of it is based on your personal effort but guided by pros   spending      additional studio hours weekly is expected to earn an a   c   d design students are earning a  fun  degree but looking toward a professional football career or a non related job promotion   the campus is lovely with architectural tiers reminiscent of mountain architecture   architecture   glass blowing programs are great too uta is a good place to receive your college education  the faculty and staff on campus are fully dedicated to helping their students  while they expect the best out of them and don t take it easy on them  they do their best to help them succeed in their classes  it wouldn t hurt to upgrade some of their buildings and add extra parking  but they are beginning to take the necessary steps to accomplish those thingsit has an amazing atmosphere  people  and location  if you want to experience a wonderful journey then the university of texas arlington is the perfect choice i like that the instructors were relatable  and the dean of the program was always available for a meeting  the campus is close and centralized enough for commuting from ftw  the campus also has a lot of valuable resources for their students including gyms  health clinics  and tutors this campus is uniquely diverse and i believe that is one of uta s best qualities  they accept and allow all sorts of different people and i presume that this fact helps a student s learning abilities because it exposes them to all sorts of cultures  also the professors are very interactive in the classroom during lecture  which improves a students  success  the only aspect i would change about this school is to increase its priority to more than just their engineering programs  for a college to flourish all programs should be showcased equally  yes the highlight of uta is their nursing and engineering programs  but their music program is widely talented and should be benefited more  also education and business those are the most important jobs to handle besides being an engineer or a nurse  but all in all  i m really enjoying my first year of being in college  and i like the calm  modern  technologically advanced  atmosphere that uta has given to me professors here are great and down to earth  most of them   books from the campus bookstore cost a lot  but chegg com is a lifesaver  uta places a heavy emphasis on diversity  but even more so on acceptance  kine department is wonderful  i am glad that there is not a football team so the other sports don t get swept under the rug  i love that there are wheelchair basketball teams here  so many great opportunities i am currently enrolled in the rn to bsn online program  it is a lot of work but has been manageable so far for this busy mom and nurse i was a dual credit student part of the honors academy  the ladies working there took great care of me and my needs  the professors i had were not that great the university is growing mainly in engineering which is great but it feels as if they re forgetting about the other majors  foe example  i m in geology and my department lacks in lab equipment and even professors  we just don t have enough of them it is very easy to get to through public transportation and there is always something happening at campus  nthe professors are my favorite part of the university  they are very professional and interact with the students in a way that makes us feel at ease when joining in the class discussions my experience here at the university of texas at arlington has been a really  good one   i have learned so much more about my area of study and i have also enjoyed all of my professors and their classes   i feel like the academics here are very challenging  but so well worth it   there are a lot of student organizations and activities to get involved in on or around the campus university of texas at arlington is a great school  this university is a filled with many diverse cultures and will give you the opportunity to experience those many cultures  very friendly environment and tuition will not cost as high as other schools the area around arlington campus is trying to improve but there is constantly construction somewhere  this is not a party school what i liked about the university of texas at arlington was the staff was very helpful and supportive to the students  in order for each student to be successful in the courses you take  there are teachers assistants that are ready and available if you need extra help and tutoring  there are computer labs available if you need to complete your homework on campus  it had a lot of amenities available to be a successful student it seems like a great school that can be a place for many different degrees and it affordable to other like colleges i have enjoyed acquiring my degree from uta  some courses are more difficult than others and have been a struggle  but the reward of hard work becomes all the more satisfying  i have become a better writer  thinker  and have grown much from my experiences and connections at uta  it is reasonably priced compared to other schools and they offer good financial aid  as a kinesiology student  the gym is fabulous and my degree specific classes have not been disappointing  each course towards my degree makes me more and more excited for my future as an athletic trainer uta has a lot to offer  from the various student organization to the networking it provides through the career development center  there is always some sort of resource to expand on your education  uta is at the center of a slowly but surely growing downtown arlington attending the university of texas at arlington has been one of he best experiences of my life  the best quality is the amount of diversity that you can experience while being there  you can meet people from all over the world and learn so much about them  so much growth takes place and i truly wish everyone could experience what is it like to attend this university so far i love everything about uta the classes are great and there are always events going on  the food from the connection cafe is great and i love how once in a while they do a hawaiian themed lunch which is a great change from the usual lunch choices  i also like how one can fall asleep pretty much anywhere outdoors and nobody seems to care  another thing that i like about uta is that the professors are very kind and understanding and always try to help in the best way possible  when it comes to financial aid uta does a pretty good job in helping its students get the help they need they give you a variety of options to help you get the money that you need  they also have plenty of on campus jobs that students can apply for n when it comes to the classes i ve only attended for a semester  however  the general class size is around       students which aren t too bad compared to other universities  all in all it s a great university to attend in order to get into the education program you have to first take the thea test  then you must apply to the program and go to a seminar  the most important criteria for getting in is making sure you have the gpa  the best tip for getting into the program is just work hard in your core classes and just keep working at it the education program on my campus is amazing  the advisers are always so helpful and able to answer any question that is asked  the program overall is the best choice i have made  the program is definitely helping me to be prepared for the when i am finally in a class teaching  the only concern i have is about finding a good job in the area i plan to live in after college the students at my college are all pretty nice  they are mostly wearing polo shirts  sagging jeans  and the newest tennis shoes out there  most are into supporting out basketball team no matter what  for the most part  everyone is friendly on campus and easy to get along with when its a class over my major  the workload does not bother me so muchi think that a relationship with the professors is importanti have had a good experiencethere is diversity in every aspectmaybe should be a little more strictits a lot like any other college  i live at home so ill not that involvedgreek life is mainly linked with partiesfacilities are good  campus is a good sizei am a mature adult student who lives off campus   i have enjoyed attending school because most of the professors are excellent  the students are very diverse and come from many parts of the globe   if i were in my late teens or early twenties i would join one of the many clubs and live on campus to fully enjoy the college experience i was able to apply for financial aid and several scholarships online   however  i suggest that students visit the financial aid office a few times during the school year to pick up scholarship applications of local organizations that do not offer online applications since i transferred to uta from the local community college  the registration process was fairly easy because they have transfer agreements with uta and all my core classes transferred easily  most of the education professors are excellent and the workload is reasonable the college of education fully prepares teacher candidates to pass the certifications tests   uta has partnerships with the local school districts so that teacher candidates can observe classrooms and complete the student teaching requirements to obtain their degree and teacher certifications uta is located between dallas and fort worth   since public transportation is limited in arlington  a car is very helpful to get to the many attractions  activities  cultural events  shopping  and sporting events in the area  the area welcomes students to get into the education program teacher candidates must have a     gpa prior to entering their junior year   they must also take a thea test and pass with above average scores   take advantage of resources such as the writing center and math tutors to help you make the grades  use study guides to help you pass the thea i am studying to become an elementary school teacher with a certification in english as a second language   i feel that uta is helping to fully prepare me for this career   with this certification i feel certain that i will be able to find a job i feel relatively safe on campus due to the visibility of police and security officers   however there have been several reports this semester of robberies and attempted robberies of mobile phones   most of these occurred in the evening or overnight when students were walking alone if you get caught  it s badengineering is awesome  not many activities thoughengineering  arch and business are best getting through orientation as freshman sucksnobody really cares  except for basketballit s texas  one day it snows  next day    degrees    mins from dallas  sports galore  and mall escorts available  not      safe though none yet  plan on it thoughdifficulty is there for sure everything is packed at lunch time  bewarefor a small school  there are big opportunitieseh pizza  burgers  asian  about itsometimes money goes missing for a long timei think we re all okay everyone knows where to get liquor if wantedthe workload is sometimes heavy  but it s to be expected  however with job opportunities it seems that you re left on your own to find them so far i ve had mostly great professors  in terms of studying  the floors above the second one are excellent from what i ve seen  they are strict on things that need to be watched out for  otherwise they are lenient  which is fine the buses that transport people around campus are great  however the wait time for some of them can be terrible they are very prominent when asking new students to rush  however  after that if you don t know many of those involved  you don t really hear anything about it for the most part everyone seems to be sociable  however at times even saying hi to a girl you don t know seems to cause them to be a bit annoyed our engineering department is is apparently one of the best  if not the best in the country from what i ve been told and seen i m on the billiards team and so i m usually in the mac  and the mac is generally a nice place to hang out after class the prospect of med school is great  however if i could redo it  i d choose a course with a backup plan  or with more options in terms of employment since my program was biology  i didn t really have to do anything after admission into college the ones i ve visited seem to be alright i ve met some great people  but i feel like there is more that i can do to actually enjoy my time there to the fullest i bring my own laptop to school  but it s nice to have some computers immediately available for use when i m in a hurry support for the varsity teams on campus is slowly increasing with changes to how they are organized  which is great there s a lot of food options  however sometimes it tastes bland from what i have heard  the ut arlington basketball teams receive the most support  however  it is not widely supported  and neither are the other sports we have  i have rarely seen or heard anything of our intramural teams  usually the most popular sport and source of school spirit on a campus is the campus s football team  but uta does not have one texas weather is known for being extreme  i have gone to class during all types of weather  the only problem i have with the weather is when i drive to and from school and then walk to class  but the weather is okay as long as you properly prepare for the day ut arlington is an average school  i was initially an english major  a program that i did not enjoy  however  i really love the journalism program  which i am currently enrolled in  uta is mostly known for its nursing program  which is staffed with excellent teachers  the school has a library  which is a great place for studying  and a new gym called the mac  a great place to work out at  however  i do not believe i would choose this school again because of the english program i have not eaten at any restaurants off campus  i usually only eat at the on campus cafeteria  however  from what i have learned from reviews online and friends  the restaurants serve decent food for a high price the journalism program at ut arlington is great  all of the teachers i have had have been extremely knowledgable about everything from sentence structure to ap style and have been available outside of class to answer questions  however  the teachers are difficult and give a big workload i have been a ut arlington student for two years now  and i have never felt any threats or issues to my health or safety  police could be more present on campus  but they definitely do their part to keep students  faculty and staff safe while on campus ut arlington has an excellent nursing program  and has many excellent staff and teachers available  many students at uta are enrolled in the nursing program  all other programs are mediocre  neither being excellent nor horrible i did not enjoy life as an english major at ut arlington  my teachers never made it clear what the criteria for assignments were  graded work harshly and gave little explanation as to what mistakes were made  however  uta s journalism program is excellent  the teachers i have had are all very knowledgable  helpful and reasonable  the english program offers a writing center on the  th floor of the main library  while the journalism program is home to the shorthorn  the school newspaper ut arlington is a fairly safe campus  campus police officers and students usually get along fairly well  although officers are not always on patrol around campus  there is an on campus station and an emergency  non emergency number and several security posts where you can reach campus police by  police are very strict  however  about parking  and a permit is required at all times the math program was easy to get into but you have a lot of work to do to stay in it and it takes a lot of studying  stay in study groups and go to tutoring  if you have a question always ask i am happy with  my program  just must get involved more  if i could do it over again  i would switch my major and minor  my career goals are either be a teacher  start off at an high school ap teacher and mover up to an college professor  or work at google  playstation  or microsoft academics are good here  make sure you rate your professor your first two years  now i will say after you start getting deeper into your major you will have not much control over class time and teacher because there will be one time  and one teacher offered for some important classes being a math major it is fun  i can go into different paths either be a teacher or back up my major with computer minor and go work at a business like google police protrol all the time and uta police are always there when you call there are shuttle buses for on campus and they just got the mav express for train travel  also there are mega buses around so far i love uta  its all about how you take on where you are at and how involved you get financial aid process is all about how you handle it and how efficient you are with doing it on time there are off campus apartments right next to campus and they are advertise on campus  some are furnished and some are not  pro is you will have more money without having to pay for a meal plan  con space is limited and goes fast the athletics program is doing an uprising since uta is so academically known  they tend to oversee the athletics but its is on a rise i love arlington  my aunt lives here and every summer for two weeks while i was in high school i would come stay with her and my cousin  i enjoyed everyday  there is a lot to do here in arlington  six flags  hurricane harbor  parks mall  mac  and plenty of restaurants there are a lot of unique things about uta for the most part how diverse it is makes it so unique  there are different cultures living among each other and joining forces student life on campus is great  i love the mac which is the mavericks recreation center  there are a lot of student involved events on campus and the library is going to be your home away from home  there is this awesome green space on the roof of the engineering building its beautiful i m not in the greek life but i have friends who are and they say it is amazing  also them being my friends i some what enjoy it also they do a lot of great things uta is an non smoking campus so not even cigarettes  they enforce drug and alcohol usage very well the food is awesome on campus  personally i love chick fil a on campus living is great for your first two years  i did it and meet some of my great friends i know now at uta there is something always going on  you just have to affiliate yourself with others and get involved uta is very diverse college and its awesome because they support everyone s background and try to help other s understand also it can be very pretty one day and gloomy the next but overall its okay nice weather i do not live on campus  but from what i have heard  it seems pretty average  although pricing is extremely high  students can choose from a variety of dorms  both old and fairly new  all of the housing options are in good locations on campus there are many lots around campus available for student parking  the annual cost for a student car permit is       pricey but unavoidable if you need to drive to and from school every day  uta cops are generous with handing out tickets and give fines of about     to those without a permit  lots    and    are the best places to park  while lot    is only convenient if you arrive by   or   a m  the streets cooper and matlock  the main streets that run through uta  have many stoplights and are busy before and after elementary school and work hours  so i suggest planning accordingly  however  the parking lots are all conveniently located  so the walk to class is never a hassle i m actually not very familiar with off campus housing  but i would assume that it is about average uta is still a small school  the school population is growing faster than the rate of facilities that are being established  but for their size uta has a lot to offer and is only growing this is a huge commuter school and although there are a lot of on campus activities not everyone participates  however  there are always large outcomes to events and there are active sororities and fraternities all the parties are fun mine is international business  spanish  and minoring in accounting everyone is pretty chill and friendly most financial aid is completed online  students can log into mymav  where they can then view their financial aid  accept or decline awards and report other financial aid all campus parties are open for all students  the biggest party on campus is the bash  hosted in college park center featuring djs and lights  there are several bars around campus for those of age  which have nice atmospheres and have a regular flow of student customers i am not in a greek sorority myself and have never tried to join  however  i have seen many greek fraternity and sorority chapter booths around campus recruiting students  and there are always students on campus wearing their greek chapter shirts i have never used public transportation to get to or from ut arlington  most students  including myself  drive to and from school  although the streets are somewhat crowded before and after work hours during the week and on the weekends  there is easy access to parking lots across campus  taxis at uta are rare the only drug and alcohol use i have seen on campus would be at parties in dorms  otherwise  students are rarely seen smoking or drinking on campus dallas has several professional sports teams  and the most popular  the texas rangers and cowboys  practice in stadiums right in arlington  downtown arlington is very nice and has a variety of restaurants  food trucks and a small outdoor arena  there are also many restaurants  both fast food and dine in  located around arlington  for shopping  the parks mall is located right off ih    between cooper and matlock streets  and the grand prairie outlet mall is only ten minutes down the highway i am not familiar with the campus meal plan dining hall  but the regular cafeteria in the university center has many options  such as subway  chick fil a  pizza hut and panda express  there is also another asian food option and a variety of drinks and packaged foods  around the corner is a mini grocery store for to go snack foods  for those looking to satisfy their coffee cravings  there are several starbucks on campus  there is also an einstein bros bagels on the first floor of the fine arts building  although all of these options are a little pricey and do not accept gift cards  the variety is quite nice there are many places you can go on campus if you need to use a school computer  computers are available in the uc  library  maverick activities center  and in computer labs and classrooms in most buildings on campus  although you might have a hard time finding a computer that has adobe programs such as photoshop  every computer i have used on campus has had basic functions such as access to the internet and microsoft programs  the uta network s speed is average  and i would suggest investing in a personal computer rather than using school printers that cost to print the students at ut arlington are nice  eager to learn and social  most students are young adults and look and dress about average  students involved with organizations set up booths during the week in front of the library and both outside and inside the university center  the library  uc and gym are where most students hang out at  while there are dorms on campus  most of the students who attend ut arlington are commuters  this greatly effects the social life on campus the alert system is fantastic  they text and email safety alertsthey allow a lot of political demonstrations which is kind of annoying to me compared to my previous experiences with financial aid at my former university  the process at my current university went a lot more smoothly  the campus understands that during the early parts of school semesters  that it is necessary extend office hours beyond normal working hours to provide any additional services to students the students are very much involve in the baseball team study options allows each student the opportunity to study in the nursing labs  study as a group or study in the library strict rules are made and continuos monitoring is done to check on the illegal activities including drinking  smoking and taking drugs on campusit s really great and life is enjoyable at this universitywe can find all kinds of pc s and laptops including mac and windows versions rnrnwifi is of good speedrnrnprinting costs around   cents per page and scanning is for freeeducation is always transforming here based on the requirements of the industries and to make students ready for the employment world and to face any challenges there isn t much during night unless you find someone to go hangout withthe police here are assisted by the city police in maintaining safety rnrnthey are very helpful and everywhere booths are setup for emergenciesthere is very much to learn here  some professors do research and we can assist them  this is of mutual benefit to us  professors encourage us to get internships  jobs  presentation ceremonies though we can find many opportunities  the increasing number of students makes it hard for us to find one  huge competition is there here having been in texas  no one can forecast weather in this area rnrnone time sunny  once rainy and some time snowrnrngreat twists  climate plans on ushere importance is given only to the talent  but not any kind of discriminationas i am a veggie  i had to repeat a bunch of dishes each time i visit rnrnbut for non vegetarians you can find excellent variety of foods and the quality is also very good at an affordable price  we get some student discount also at select restaurants  this is the best partif i reject a housing contract  then the housing department assumes i don t want to live on campus at all  this is stupid  if i reject the contract then that means i want to be notified when there is a better offer available you have to know the right people or else there s nothing to do on the weekends if there are no events going on on campus  then there are no events going on the education is excellent  but the workload is ridiculous you will meet all different shapes and sizes of people at uta the engineering student services isn t the best  and the professors all have thick accents that are hard to understand  but it s tolerable you don t really have to apply to get into the engineering department  once you meet the requirements they automatically put you in i personally have a meal plan on campus  so i don t eat out much  but there are so many different places i want to try  almost all international students can find a slice of home in the cuisine near campus not enough students come out to the games the only problem is that they do not have enough servers for all the computers to be logged on at once  you may find yourself waiting for up to    minutes if everyone is on computers that day there are so many different restaurants available within a reasonable distance to uta i really don t know  as i said before  i am a single mother who works and goes to school  i don t have time for any of this  also  i know that people who do drugs and so forth stay with people who do drugs  i m never approached about them because i m sure they see i m not interested i love the social work program  there are many clubs to join relating to my field  also  since i am interested in the field i actually really enjoy my courses i am in the social work program  the process is very simple to apply  if you re not sure you can always ask an advisor or their assistant for help too i haven t attended a game yet for uta  i have seen things being advertised though and heard fellow students talking about them summer time is hot  it s texas  spring is the best and winter varies  walking from class to class isn t the greatest sometimes financial aid was awarded in a timely manner  my classes were not dropped  although  when i went in to the office to check on something the person that was helping me didn t seem to know the answer but made something up  i had her go double check i don t live in a dorm so i m not sure how life is living there  i don t ever seem to have a problem with strictness though  i follow the rules and do what i m supposed to do arlington is located in the middle of all kinds of sporting events  the at t stadium  dallas cowboys  and globe life park  rangers stadium   there are also plenty of museums and libraries  the possibilities are endless there are many different clubs for ethnic groups  my program is social work  where that is a key focus i m not greek but it seems cool i like living on campus  i am even moving into a new apartment this summer  love it herei like arlington  everything like dance studios  theaters  etc are within walking distance the teachers take an interest in the lives of their students  they want everyone to learn and passthey are everywhere  each building has its own lab and they run fast texas weather can be unpredictable i have my own car  so i don t need transportation i lve on campus  so i don t know much about the off campus housing we have a large variety of restaurants to choose from on and off campus i love my dorm  but it s expensive when you don t have many scholarships most students attend sporting events on campus i filled out a fafsa  but i didn t qualify for anything except loans i m not really into greek life  so i don t know much about it i m not really around people who drink or do drugs we have a lot of things to here  but studying is priority i don t mind rules  they keep us safe i don t party  so i don t know i don t go to many sporting eventstexas weather is always unpredictablei m in the bachelor for biology teaching and the program has small class loads and very personal there are a lot of computer labs availableit s hard to find any scholarships for a person with my income statuseverybody is excepted here and the school gives help for low income peoplethere is a beautiful campus and everybody is very helpfuli haven t started classes but the tour looked greatthere are many options of transportationthere are places to get free printing  as a college student  this will be to your benefit  oh how i love this school for its technology  they are going to perk it up for      so stay tuned uta is great for engineers and nursing students  these are the top study areas  nursing students  i  an engineering student  envy you  you have really cool equipment  that s not to say uta engineers have it bad bioengineering practically have our own new costly building  and i am loving the perks  honestly if you are studying engineering or nursing this is the school for you its very tranquil  and not very much like its sister school ut austin  party school   uta is calm  and one hardly has parties  there are though stuff to do at nights like the movies they play  pretty cool hangout oh and they have concerts too you literally are warned about drugs  before you even go  you should know better  drugs and what not are strictly forbidden this is what uta is known for diversity  it is absolutely awesome meeting people from different backgrounds  one learns alot  and it s really great there are more and more ways of transportation on campus  recently the max opened and it connects cities from fort worth to dallas and everything in between  including uta  also its i think    for uta students either one or four don t remember sometimes it gets a bit cold or rainy especially during the winter  but there are ways to get to class without having to be outside too much  usually you can tell there will be bad weather if no one is walking outside of the library haven t been to any sporting events  but from what i have heard they are pretty good greek life is not big or small at uta  there are a bit of each type of sorority and fraternity any student is looking for  i m not in a sorority but plan to rush soon  from what i ve observed  the sororities look like they have a lot of fun and enjoy helping each other and the community  there are four phc sororities but don t let that small number fool you  the girls are sweet and kind  on any ordinary day you ll see all the greeks wearing their letters on campus  uta has phc ifc nphc and mgc  the phc and ifc are kind of the only ones that have houses and they re located on greek row which is near the mac  if you re interested in going greek i strongly advice you to go for it  do your research first to make sure it s for you and then go for it this is texas  if you re not from texas then you may have a problem with the weather  i m from houston so i totally understand this crazy weather  one day it ll be hot and sunny and then the next day you ll have to pull out the boots  texas weather is bipolar and that s the truth  it gets really cold during the end of the year and the beginning  we ve received a heavy amount of sleet snow and have had classes canceled   after awhile the weather evens out and becomes somewhat normal  my only advice is to have a weather app  i check mine every morning before i get dressed  you cant just look out the window and just guess what the weather will be like  you have to check your weather app  also invest in some winter gear  jackets boots etc  you ll definitely need them around december if you live on campus  most dorms have computer labs in them but they don t have printers  if you need to print either bring your own or go to the library or the second floor of the uc to print  you ll have to put money on your mav id to print but it s only   cents a print which is way cheaper then buying your own printer  i put    dollars on my card for a semester and a half and i still haven t used it all  if you must have a printer in your room then that s fine but in my opinion using the school s printers are a good idea rnrni think having a laptop or your own desktop is highly needed at uta  you ll be using blackboard a lot and its really inconvenient to run to the library every time you need to check your grades or do online homework assignment  especially if its late at night and you forgot to do an assignment  the library does have computers  apple mac s and a few dell desktops   on weekdays the library is usually full but if you go when people are usually in class you should find a few available  the computers in the uc are all desktops and are not that busy there are blue boxes for personal safety and a clinic on campusthe scholarships awarded are greatthe psychology program is awsome  i cannot speak for the other programsthe admission to uta is straight forward and simple to get into a programit s a good aspect to protect studentsits credited and encouraged by the housing departmentavaerage weather considering its texasi do not really party  so i guess its averagethey work with charity and things like thatarlington is located between two bigger cities  dallas and ft worth  so there s plenty to do in those two cities  arlington is kind of boring thoughnot sure how to rate this one  i mean the alcohol and drugs are there if you want to partake  but no one is forcing anyone toit s arlington  tx so there s very little public transportation  most people i know have cars  traffic sucks bad thoughcampus conduct policy can be pretty overbearring at times  once got in trouble for having empty smirnoff bottles in my dorm room i ve used their services many times and have been generally pleased with the experiencefaculty i ve had are actually pretty cool  no one i ve had was too left or right in their teaching methods  thought some are  but i stay away from their classesreceived my scholarship  but they took it away because i m interning out of state    wifi is pretty good  computer labs are unused by most considering everyone has their own laptopnot the best it could be  but if you want a social life at uta  you should go greekmet some of my best friends through on campus housing so i can t complain a tonit s texas weather though so many people might not be able to handle itour school doesn t have a football team  intermurals are big in greek lifei love the program  i know i will get somewhere someday with it i it s raining outside  you have to walk through the rain to get to class i bring my own laptop and get great signal i don t notice or pay attention to any of that greek life is great and supporting i m in class at night and immediately drive home afterwards i save money and eat at home i haven t had any problems with financial aid do not live on campus not much support for our teams i like the school a lot and the education you receive from there is a good one  it is definitely a commuter college so i find it hard to meet friends because a lot of the students are only there for school and not interested in building relationships  i do find it odd still that there is not a football team the best thing i liked about the university of texas at arlington is the resources  and the involvement of those who are around you each and everyday  all of my professors were extremely helpful and supportive so far  my experience at uta has been great  student life has become interesting  i gotten to know a variety of people from different cultures  the clubs to join are fun and the activities to take part on  the instructors are great as well  they care for their students and do nothing but to push them out of their comfort zone and do their best the advisers  at least the freshman ones  are horrible and have no idea what they re doing  the honors one that i ve delt with has been great  but my freshman adviser  katy  was terrible  i had incoming credit from high school  and when it came in i had to completely change my schedule  they stuck me with a business adviser when i m a nursing student  it completely ruined the order of my classes  and i ve been left to figure out my own schedule  i came in to plan my second semester and she asked me what classes i m taking  i m worried that this will really screw over the rest of my college experience there  however  i ve met some really good friends and everyone is so nice  most of the professors have been good  and honors college is cool to be part of  campus is nice and has good facilities  and the dorms are very nice for what you pay  overall  the school is a good deal for getting a nursing or engineering degree  otherwise  i d go somewhere else my experience with ut arlington so far has been amazing  i come from lubbock texas so it was a big change coming from a smaller city than the dfw area  but ut arlington made my transition so much easier  not to mention the professors here are even better than i imagined  if ut arlington is on your list you should highly consider it it has been a great experience so far  i have learned a lot in such a short time  i am pursuing nursing and hear great things about their nursing program  the faculty is very knowledgeable of the material and go out and beyond to help us students  can t see what these next   years hold uta is a great college  the campus is beautiful and the professors are well educated in their courses and willing to work with students my semester at uta was amazing  it is my freshman year and i was really scared about it  but the people at the university helped whenever i needed it  it was also amazing how many friends i made in such less time  academically and socially i was always active  my grades improved over the semester and i went to a lot of events to keep myself busy and happy  it s a nice place to make a career because you get a lot of opportunities to explore your options and decide a path i love how the campus is cared for on the outside  the trees allow some sunlight in and the flowers are beautiful  it s refreshing to come out of a classroom to admire the beauty of nature while you re on campus for the day night  i also feel comfortable here with all the other hardworking students not bad  would love if more stuff would be going around in the campus  some of the buildings are old  the faculty is nice and caring  my first year  and i wonder why some classes even exist it sucks that they don t have a football team  but the basketball team more than makes up for it   the location makes it central to both dallas and fort worthi love this university  it has a diverse population and have met so many interesting people  my professors are great  and the classes are enjoyable  the campus is nice  there is a wide variety of food served for any meal  i am graduating in the spring i went there a couple years ago when i was touring it  i loved the university overall  it offered a lot of majors to the students  campus life is also great  the students are very friendly and welcoming  i loved it so much i m extremely proud and honored to be a student of university of texas at arlington for the fall     being a freshman i experienced many new things at the university some were good and some were bad  obviously the good comes first songood things   rich in diversitynmany organizations seeking your participation in eventsnencouraging teaching staff nbad things  around campus kind off not safe nnot a good local area ndorms having very small rooms  not worth the amount paid ntill now i could gather this much only  will update as soon as i  discovere new thingsuta is a good school for nursing and engineering  intended majors  over rall the school is good but they could improve in some areas like food services and lab appliances used in classesalthough i don t attend uta   i have visited the campus with avid before  this was an astonishing experience i encountered  due to the fact that its environment has showed me that it is a wonderful college to attend  in other words  it has bloomed my goal of attending the university of texas arlington uta is home to me  i love it there  the staff and the students are very friendly and are always there to help  the teachers always make it a point to be available and to help struggling students  the classes move at just the right pace  accommodating both the fast and slow learners  the libraries offer many resources and have plenty of computers for students to use  there are services like the math clinic that help students stay on top of their studies nnthere are so many student organizations that a person cannot fail to be part of something  from cultural organizations to unicef  there is too much to do  there are many chances to do voluntary work with organizations like circle k international  friday nights are never dull  uta offers many student activities from parties to movies i like the fast that the university academic departments  i e colleges  have many majors per college so there were many options to consider  the staff are helpful land services are fairly wellso far  it s been pretty cool  i like the environment and the food places nearby  the classes have some pretty cool teachers ni do hate parking  though  it s terrible  and while the school has a lot of commuters  i don t always feel like they accommodate commuting students all that much or make us feel very welcome  they re putting forth an effort to change that though i absolutely love ut arlington  there are many ways to get involved on campus and take advantage of all the resources  uta does a great job of building a sense of community and inclusiveness for all students haven t had to deal with strict policies much most diverse school in the area admission was easy  just put your program on the application and you get in i have no fear about finding a job  the program is great  besides some pointless classes i ve never heard of off campus housing workload is crazy and challenging   there are plenty of internships an we are well know for our engineering department safety is an issue  and you must have a vehicle to get anywhere if you have no where to go during holidays be prepared to find other places to eat  the campus dining hall shuts down  there is very minimal housing  you need to apply early and check back often with campus housing  if you can get into the dorms they are very nice  even the off campus apartments are routed through the school  both usually have a wait list if you are a first bachelor degree student then the financial aid department will bend over backwards to help you find money for school  if you already have a degree  then you are pretty much on your own  the different colleges have interdepartmental scholarships as well  there are people that will help you  but don t wait until the last minute  the financial aid office is super busy  go early the classes offered at uta transfer just about everywhere  the teachers are polite and helpful  i ve never had a bad teacher  the classes are quite rigorous  so be prepared to study  form study groups to lighten the load  for harder classes like chemistry  calculus  or biology an extra study session class is offered for free to help cement the learning from that week  if you are an off campus or online student there are just as many people willing to help you  there are many people who can conference online and via web chat when you need help  the librarians are very helpful and the writing center has been invaluable with papers and projects  just make sure to book them way in advance of your due date there are labs that are hidden that aren t the main computer labs and library computers  there is always a technician in the room to help with computer problems  if you are in the arts the computer programs for design are top notch  they have an even distribution of macs and pc s given your taste  if you are invited to the honors college you get a computer lab with extra printing capabilities all to yourself  if you live in the dorms either buy your own printer and computer or get a jump drive and walk to the nearest computer lab we have no football team  but we make up for it with men s and women s basketball  go mavs six flags  dallas cowboys stadium  texas rangers stadium  hawaiian falls water park   need i say more  uta is located in the middle of dallas and fort worth and between the two major highways  if arlington doesn t have what you want  all you have to do is drive the uta college of nursing is very challenging and rewarding  i enjoy being among the elite students who are serious about completing their degree  it is fast paced and requires dedication  i wish that i was able to work and go to school  but the nursing degree requires a commitment to studying and attending classes only  uta offers a    month program that is accelerated for students wanting to earn their bsn  the faculty is the best around and offer a unique perspective because they were nurses first before they were educators  uta partners with many different hospitals around the metroplex  so if you want a job there are many hospitals that are already familiar with the caliber of uta students and their work all the upper level majors like engineering  nursing are pretty competitive  they have their own college policies and applications  the nursing program is tough to get into unless you are a great student at the top of your class  however  all the lower level classes are rigorous enough to prepare you for everything if you are a commuter student it is hard to be involved in greek life  if you go to school at night you don t get to see the booths and fun activities that are held during the day most fast food chains accept the meal plan card and your student id is linked to a school bank account that is pre loaded with money  you can use it like a debit card at surrounding restaurants  there is a little bit of everything around uta  you just need to know where to look  it is also in the heart of arlington  great restaurants are just a drive away most of the students commute to school  so drugs and alcohol aren t as prominent on this campus as others  there are seminars about awareness and counselors who are very present and always helpful if you have a problem  arlington and uta police work very well together to keep the campus safe it s in arlington next to a jail   so   get a can of mace and keep your cell phone close  the uta police are always present and available to get you to your car  the apartments that are  off campus  are within walking distance but fill up quickly  the closest apartments are about half a mile away and in a not so great neighborhood  being that it is a commuter school you can live anywhere in the ft  worth dallas metroplex and drive to the campus texas weather is always fickle  you must always prepare for it to change  for the most part it is dry and hot  which allows for a lot of outdoor activities and fun its rewarding  but its a big hassle there are plenty of computers available to the students  however most are in the central vicinity of the campus  if you wish to have a  social  aspect close to housing spaces  you should own a laptop  the wifi is free on almost all housing though the school is sometimes closed due to weather  but nothing extremely out of the ordinary there are quite a few restaurants in the area and enough variety to never tire of a small selection i mostly spend the majority of my night time with close friends or at home i believe the university of texas at arlington was rated one of the top    most diverse schools in the country based on us news article i never feel threatened in the vicinity of the campus  despite not having a  strong  presence at the university  the safety and health clinic both work to improve the school and do well at it classes are never a bother to get to  but the housing lacks a social environment i have very little to no interaction with safety officers  i live off campuswhile there is no clear drug usage on campus i am sure that of the         students that attend that some of them part take of drugs on campustons of work and constant projects there are people from all over the country and the world with differing view points and beliefsi do not really do things around campusi do not really attend or participate in sports or sporting eventsgo enough computers for general class workthe financial aid office is wonderful  with staff and work study students willing to help at the drop of a hat   several financial aid options available  and very easy to apply forinstructors are incredibly knowledgeable and willing to offer help in and out of class to clarify ideas and questionsaside the from academic challenge of the program  the opportunities offered post graduation or much greater than what a simple business degree can offerthere is plenty of entertainment options near by  from fort worth stockyards to downtown dallas  there is never a need to drive more than    minutes to find a new exciting venue each weekthere is wifi in every building with decent connection speed   there are several computer labs across campus from those that are designated for specific majors in their respective research buildings to general use plus an ample selection in the libraryhousing for off campus students is somewhat limited   there are plenty of different apartment locations  but they are all very similar  older properties   they know you have little other choice than them and so they don t feel they have to try too hard to entice you to stayclean housing  very affordable and convenient for travel to and from classes even in inclement weather  very friendly staff and diverse array of residentstexas weather at its finest  warm except for a bit of ice in the winter  which equals january alone arlington and the dallas fort worth area is full of opportunity and events i received several excellent academic scholarships for being a transfer student off campus dining options are endless since the area is extremely diverse i do not have personal experience with the off campus housing  but everyone i know who lives off campus says it is wonderful  except for the commuter parking there is a bus which shuttles students around campus  but they could greatly benefit from more public transportation from campus to the surrounding area awesome faculty overall  especially for communication students  the internships and opportunities are endless i love living in arlington hall on campus  the only annoying thing is the meal plan requirement  but everything else is awesome student involvement is okay  but school spirit and the support of the general student body has huge room for improvement i love the public relations program at uta  the majority of the professors will challenge you  while still providing the assistance you need to succeed  each individual really decides how hard they will or will not work to attain their degree  and the program overall seems to accommodate everyone s different aspirations  i personally want to go into political public relations  hopefully planning political campaigns  this field tends to have a wide diversity of career options  broader than the specific area i aspire to most  so i m looking forward to whatever i find when i do get into a long term career admissions office is extremely helpful and it really isn t very difficult to get into this program there are a lot of off campus housing optionsthey are very helpful with anything you may needthere are plenty of computer labs and wifi if you want to use your own laptopgreek life has many events and parties to try to get people more involved not very many people doing drugs there are a lot of food places  a mall  stadiums  and six flags near by uta is very diverse  there are people from all over the place here and everyone is friendly and treated equally the major advisors are very helpful and the professors are nice and friendly there are many groups for social work majors so you become very involved in the school and community  it s a great way to meet new people and better understand your profession i don t play sports but  i love going to the mac   mavericks activities center there s not very many parties  it s not a party school so any parties would be on greek row i wish there were more financial aid possibilities nothing really attractive to those who have lived here their entire lifenumerous options for off campus dining  many give student discountsparking stickers are required which makes it difficult when you take a different car to school because your original  car is in the shopnew off campus apartments  yet are extremely expensivebeing greek does not effect the way non greeks interact but one can see that greeks gravitate toward fellow greeksrain is the most annoying because despite the use of an umbrella  you still get wet it would be nice if public transportation is available for those who live off campus  yet relatively close work load depends on major  english department could use an updated buidingcost of printing could be free considering the amount of tuition students payno one is really into the sports teams but the mac is really nice and intramurals are definitely really fun its usually really windy which bothers me because its hard to run in  but other than that its beautiful most of the timei love the local places to eat here  even though everything else in arlington is kind of awful at least the food in unique and delicious  i love babe s chicken and i love nizza pizzamost apartment complexes are run down and if not too expensivemoney is always great no matter what it took to get it arlington is ghetto and sucks very small  not like other universitiesi ve never seen anyone drunk or high near me so thats goodhard to get into the classes you need when registration comes around  professors aren t that great for your major science courses i want to be a nurse so bad but uta creates a lot of obstaclesthe computers are kind of old and outdated and you have to know how to use microsoft software i live on campus so i don t really know  i ve never personally been in trouble for anything but people are always getting parking tickets it sucks to walk to class in the rain bring your own laptop  it is so much easier i feel safe on campus and the police send out messages if something is wrong if you obey the rules you won t have any problems school is near ranger s ballpark and cowboy s stadium  they are plenty of activities around campus  including games i had a little trouble  but everyone was nice and helped me with the problem jack in the box is good there s no peer pressure that i ve seen with drug use  but the alcohol available to underage drinkers is a major event  almost any fraternity party doesn t check age for being able to drink there s tons of places right off campus to find great food for cheap  offering many options when food at school becomes mundane i m a white  middle class female and receiving financial aid is difficult  i was lucky to get any loans as far as the health center goes  i don t have much experience in dealing with them  but the safety of ut arlington is actually an issue i have  the campus police are wonderful in offering services to make sure the students here don t wander campus at night alone  but off campus there have been shootings  there have been muggings on campus  and recently some sexual assault issues have been brought up near two large cities has two major professional sports arenas nearby  there s a mall not far south of campus  the parking lots garages are on the outskirts of campus so there s not many cars in the middle of campus for students to dodge  centrally located for access from the dfw metroplex  not the safest but not the most dangerous location theres not much to do except partying  thats about it  and maybe going to target or walmart they have a lot of rules but they understand that we re adults and it s college its arlington  come on  its pretty much a ghetto city with the cowboys stadium and the university its crutches im gonna be honest  this school is great  but the city of arlington is ghetto  you can meet some shady people if you go off campus and there are a lot of people stealing iphones for some reason  if its night and youre not walking with at least   people  including you  then call the campus police escortthe commuters at school are great  they have macs and dell computers if you re interested in that  and there are quite a bit of computer labs all throughout campus  the printing on campus is cheap  but they only provide those at the library  the one problem i have an issue with is the wifi  the campus wifi is great but only available in the building on campus  the personal wifi  i think its resnet or apogee  is crappy  you d think we would have at least have the commercial wifi grade available to on campus resident but no they are always offering help meetings to write resumes  they also have a lot of job fairs and internship fairs i really enjoy being in the business department  there are a lot of groups to join  and they offer great scholarships to business students i have not had any trouble getting into the business department and the advisers ave very friendly arlington is a good city but i would much rather live in my home town i have to walk a long way from my car to the classes so if it is raining or cold it is not comfortable  i also have to drive a long way to school which makes road conditions very important to me as well i really enjoy watching and seeing our campus succeed in sports i have never seen it used an smoking is banned from the campus  i have heard people talking about it during the daylight times i feel safe at night it feels dangerous and wondering if someone is going to take something from you  there are also a lot of rundown apartments by the campus i do not live on campus and i haven t really heard a lot about the dorms the great thing about arlington is that it s right in between dallas and fort worth  two cities with lots to do  arlington itself doesn t have a whole lot of out of the ordinary things to offer but it doesn t have rangers baseball and dallas cowboys stadiums  lots of sports activities are available to attend at the university  if you re into that sort of thing  everyone here is really friendly and i have never gotten any negative attitudes towards me because i am a uta student the website to register for classes is extremely difficult to navigate because when you click on a link it opens up additional windows where you have to again log on to the website  the professors  for the most part  have been very helpful and the workload for the course have been very manageable for a student who works full time there is a large diversity of students of various ethnic backgrounds  texas is known as the melting pot after all landlord was reasonable as long as i kept up the housei live near dallas and fort worthi like it warm    i hate the cold    not as big as state campuses  but pretty popular for the smaller school wifi everywhere  and every  hangout  spot has computers to use no football team  hopefully soon to come back  the mac is a wonderful facility  and i can t get enough of it  the varsity sports present are indeed great  though many great programs and also new president refurbishing programs that have dropped in rank recently  nice to see great to have so many different people surrounding you  learning about different cultures and religions is much more fun and easy when you hear personal experience good food  and cost as much as a meal at chili s give or take  many options as well campus police are very present on campus you won t find any trace of drugs on campus great houses on campus  looked up to by many non greeks uta is one of the most diverse colleges in america the academic program for engineering is excellent police really crack down on drugs and drinking here campus shuttles and buses to the airport are great if someone wanted to use drugs or take part in underage drinking or anything like that  they probably could  the campus isn t riddled with drugs and alcohol  but you know it s there  not a huge deal  though you can bring you laptop almost anywhere on the uta campus  the internet connection is very reliable  when every it does go out  an email is sent to all students letting us know when and for how long we ll be disconnected  it s also a distraction    it s much easier to go the classes and have a social life when you live right there with everything the teachers are great for the most part  www ratemyprofessor com doesn t lie   the nursing and engineering programs are probably what uta is know best for  the study abroad program is really good  as well  the workload depends on your degree plan and your work ethic  the registration process is fairly easy as long as you stay on your advisor about getting everything together it s relatively safe  of course there are dangers  but it s nothing too out of the ordinary  the main thing would be the police escort services not running on the weekends when most of the drama happens it s busy outside of campus  but you don t know unless you look  most locals are nice towards students and understanding of the life of a college student  there are two sports stadiums near campus  but it doesn t affect student life much  the mall isn t too far away and there is a bus route that goes everywhere i think greek life is really cool  they all seem like genuinely nice people  i also like that at uta  there is a greek lettered organization for all ethnicities  it s really nice to see i m an international business   french major  i love the courses i have to take  lots of math and french  very little science beyond the basic prerequisites to graduate  i plan on starting my own business either in the fashion industry or something that helps children  or both there are a lot of thing available  you just have to be proactive and ask about them and look for them  because people aren t going to tell you uta is super diverse  there are all kinds of people everywhere and i love it they are all mostly the same  the defining factor is usually the prices overall  my school does more than excellent job at handling electronic needs for the most part  i do believe everyone here in accepting dining options around the campus are very accessible with proper knowledge i couldn t agree more that this program is very fit for me the application process was very understandable and i was squared away in no time the nice thing is you are not that far from downtown dallas or downtown ft  worth   so if things aren t poppin off in arlington  you can check out dallas or ft  worth depending upon what you re into the classes were really enjoyable and being in the dallas ft  worth metroplex  you have a wealth of internship opportunities in the    media market in the country most of the faculty are phds and they are tenured and published so you have the opportunity to learn from subject matter experts   you will get out of it what you put into it there have been a lot of new additions to off campus housing  making it easy and affordable for students to live off campus most restaurants are close to campus and they cater to the student body there because that is their lifeline for their business its chilly and cool to roam aroundnever tried going on them but heard that they are okayits going well and everything is nice around methey could really put a few places on the west side of campus  currently the only option is a bagel place   for those of us that have our classes on the west side of campus it can be a bit of a walk to the food options on the east side of campus  some of the buildings have been updated and are nice  however there are others that could very badly use some updating  the grounds keepers are always hard at work keeping the grass neatly trimmed  sidewalks cleared  etc  they could use some food places on the west side of campus  the only option really is einsteins  everything else is a bit of a walk  the landscaping is well taken care of  the fine arts library could use a few more tables for students to work at  the mac is great  probably would have gone to a different school that was smaller  and less traffic  i come from a smaller town  and it has been a little overwhelming at times  plus had i gone to a different school i would have graduated sooner  going here pushed my graduation back by a year and a half  there are not enough parking spots for our rapidly growing student population  so thankfully i live close enough off campus to walk bike to school  however if you do need to park you better get there before       classes start otherwise you wont find a spot till later in the afternoon  the campus police are constantly patroling and writing tickets for cars parked in non parking areas or without parking passes  there are a lot of choices between fast food and regular sit down places  italian  indian  asian  pizza places  and bars  definately recommend pizza and suds  some places have student discounts with your student id  but not many  rain makes the walkways extremely slippery and there tend to be lots of big puddles  if there is a lot of ice they tend to cancel classes  dont live on campus  so i can only say really that they do enforce parking stickers and do not tolerate cheatingplenty of computer areas  and for the most part there is wifi all over campus we do have a lot of crime reports  plenty of shopping    miles from the cowboys stadium  rangers stadium  and   flagsit is close enough to the city where you can get away easily  there are many stores around that are convenient for students right amount of rules to be followed uta provides a wonderful shuttle program  helping students get to their classes and then back to their cars  the only problem is that there doesn t seem to be enough shuttles here in texas the weather changes constantly  in the morning you have to bundle up and in the afternoon you re sweating  my classes are all in different buildings currently  so trekking out in the cold to my next class is almost unbearable sometimes as parts of the campus act as wind tunnels  only making matters worse the university of texas at arlington is the only four year university i have attended  that being said  it is difficult to judge how it compares to other universities  however  i am having a wonderful time here at uta and it s wonderful engineering program and student organizations such as the aeromavs club which builds a rocket to compete against other colleges across the nation every year and won first in the target altitude and planetary rover events last year they have a lot of new restaurants that you can choose from if you want to try something new and exciting  the restaurants are fun and fresh and new for college students uta definately lets you know of all of the study sessions and si leaders in every class if you need help  i feel that  you have some great professors and the registration process is good  the workload is what you make it unless you are a financial student and have to be full time but that is only four classes and very doable if you have a good work study ethic sociology is cool and laid back as long as you attend class regularly you will get the full experience and understanding of the topics presented in class  the curriculum is laid out in a very good and understable way  the program is easy and they help to get you to graduation i had a smooth ride getting my financial aid and loans its okay  but i think that they should have a shuttle to take students with a family places off campus i think the school is okay and people dress nice  people tend to hang with people they know its not that noticeable to me because i live off campusnot very good with scholarshipit s proximity with dallas and fort worth set it a part from other school  i can still have great opportunities for jobs but at the same time i can have a school town feeling within arlingtonit s on all the time  students have activities and gathering in school all the time   it s a very active school  i love it it s great   i have seen people from variety of ethnicity so i am impressed how melting pot it iswell i feel very safe in the campus with campus police cars on the road all the time it s ok buildings seems very old but well maintained  not a pleasure experienceit s ok just a regular school with student tricks to manage drugs and alcoholso far my classes  teachers and assignments are industry standards and that s what companies are looking for in a graduate studenti am doing mis and information systems in my school is one of the best in state with very unique and industry leveled courses offeredthe apartments are not that great in condition but proximity is very close  you don t have to walk fari am not into games but so far the facilities is very sufficient for studentsthe weather is one of my reason i am going to uta  best weather little harsh in june july  but awesome year longit s a party school   and easily availablethe transportation availability is greati love the strictness because it make university a better placethe food service is very good   it is easily available with great variety of course college is difficult  but if you apply yourself and study  you ll be fine  the professors like when you come to them and ask questions about a topic that you don t understand  they are willing to go above and beyond to help educate you  nursing school at ut arlington is extremely competitive  last semester  the first    students that got accepted into the nursing program had gpas of      about     students apply and only     are accepted the cities around arlington are wonderful  there s always something to do i ve never heard of anyone having problems with the campus police the girls on campus get on my nerves most of the time the hall that i live in is amazing  it is far away from the rest of campus  but it s worth the private room this college was better than i expected in some ways  this school is perfect if you are trying to get your degree and get out in the world  this isn t big on school sprite and other things university of texas at arlington is a beautiful campus  this school is full of diversity and community support  i wouldn t change a thing about it  university of texas at arlington is perfect the way it is the school is very diverse  i loved everything from the dorms  cafe  and gym  the school is a place for those not trying to go far for school  i went there for cheer camp and the people there made the experience so much fun  the university of texas at arlington has professors that care about their students  it makes a big difference  i dont believe i could go to another college and being exposed to professors who are genuine and that i can relate withwhen i visited the university of texas at arlington i loved my overall experience  it was quite pretty and interesting to see it  my experience was fun and i loved the campus i m pretty interested in this school and may consider going to it uta has a very friendly and open environment that is very welcoming  it is known as one of the most diverse schools in the state of texas and i feel because of that  you can meet new people from all over  have an excellent academic experience from well trained professionals  and also have many extra curricular activities open to you as a student   my overall experience was amazing and with out a doubt i met the best people and teachers and created life long friendships i love the diversity of uta  it creates a very unique environment  i also like the variety of classes available for students and the research prestige of the school overall  i ve had a great experience at the university of texas at arlington  it is a very diverse school and i love that because i enjoy being around people who are different than me and learning something new about other cultures every day  in my opinion  that is one of the best things about this college  you learn to feel comfortable and be open to all kinds of people  which is important  furthermore  i ve had a good experience with the teachers that i ve had  as they have all been very knowledgeable and i have learned a lot from them  the only things i would improve are to be able to see professors before we choose our classes  as we often have to end up choosing to take a class without knowing who will teach it until a few days before  also  i would add a football team if i could because i feel like the school spirit is often lacking  as we don t have any team representing us in the college leagues  they have a great science department as well as a wonderful nursing program   lots of diversity among the student body and social events what i first enjoyed about this school was the diversity  you get to meet different people from different places  theres alot of ameneties where students can  hang out  my favorite thing about the school is how diverse it is  everyone is friendly and accepting  it makes you feel more at home  the school is great   it has amazing proffesors  i would like to see more opportunities around the community i liked how the environment was very friendly and the university was amazing in general  i would not change anything about the college  i love how the university of texas at arlington allows you to be an individual  there is no pressure to  fit in  like high school  i also love how diverse it is  so many different people from all walks of life are always on campus  it is a commuting school so most people do not live on campus but you will always see people hanging out in the library or in the mac  i also like the the professors are dedicated to providing a higher education  you get a better look at your degree and see how you will fit in to the field   the advisors are also very helpful in finding the best plan for you and figuring it what course load you can handle at the time i love uta for it s academics  student life  and diversity college is not for everyone  but it is by far one of the best choices i have made in my life  i came into orientation a few weeks prior to the start expecting to just go to class  work  and study  i then met beta theta pi at orientation  one thing i can say to make your college experience better is to get involved  it helps you make new friends  meet tons of new people  it might even help you get better jobs and internships  beta opened many doors for me that would ve been closed forever if i hadn t met them  i know that when i graduate  my resume is going to look great because of them  because of all the clubs and organizations i joined  because of all the community service hours i would ve completed  they have made my   months of college so much better than that  i always have something to do  i always have people to talk to and hangout with  i love college and am enjoying every moment of it  the website allows for easy access to scholarships and general college information to all parties involved  the reduced the stress and disorder that comes with applying to various schools and for various scholarshipsi live in an apartment barely off campus so i cannot say much about the residence halls and apartments on campus  but from what i ve heard and seen  it s not too bad living on campus  all the dorms i ve visited are very clean and well kept outside of what residents do to them  so they definitely are not bad as mentioned  i am a part of greek life  i joined beta theta pi  i met them at orientation  and they made it seem very nerdy  so i almost decided to join kappa alpha order  they were very cool  and seemed to be more the party type  but beta got me involved right away and ka never contacted me  the easiest way to join a frat is hanging out with them a lot prior to rush week  i hung out with beta for   months before i rushed  but when it came to bid day  they told me they were very excited to bid me  they knew my love for them  finding the right fraternity is all about finding the right fit  we have the party type fraternities on campus  and then we have fraternities like beta who like to party  but we also like to do more laid back activities and have fun than anything else  because partying doesn t build brotherhood  but playing golf  going to lunch with one another  and just hanging out at various places getting to know each other does  we are also very involved on campus  probably more so than any other fraternity  we are one of the more respectable  if not the most respectable groups on campus i don t know much about uta s varsity sports  but i know we are passionate about our intramurals  we hold events at least once a week  ranging from oozeball  which is muddy volleyball  to bubble soccer  we have large amounts of people playing and watching  and it is very fun and enjoyable for everyone  the only team i ever play for is my fraternity  but there are teams for each fraternity  sorority  dorms  clubs  and apartments i chose to get as involved as i can with my school through a fraternity and so far it has been the best choice i have made in college  many people look at a fraternity as a group of guys that like to get laid and drunk  and that may be the case with a lot of them  my fraternity  beta theta pi  is said to be one of the best in the us  we strive to build men of principle  so when they graduate college  they will be far more successful and better off than if you weren t in a fraternity or in another drunken fraternity  it has gotten me very involved on campus and i know way more people than if i weren t in a fraternity  it opened many doors for me  including a better life  a new family  and lifelong friendships  getting involved on campus is definitely one of the best things anyone can do while staying on campus i went in and told them that i needed to take out a loan  the lady asked   how much   i told her and i received my refund check that next week i love ut arlington  the professors are the best  they are so willing to help  the students are always friendly  the employees are always friendly  and there are many campus activities throughout the semester the restaurant options are endless off campus  i feel like all arlington is is restaurants parties mostly happen on the weekends  that i know of  i ve been to a few at the off campus apartments and it was pretty fun i ve never used the computer labs because i have my own laptop  the computers in the science labs are great  though i ve only been to one of the off campus apartments  it was very nice and it was walking distance to campus the weather is not so bad the shuttle on campus is great  half of the campus is on one side of a highway and the other half is on the other side of the highway  so the shuttle allows students a ride across the road  also on the weekends for     the shuttle will take you to the mall in the morning and back that night the process is easy but how the university deducts the money from our accounts is very weak and takes more time then they say  the safety and security on campus is the best  the school has a escort system and emergency stations all around campus for students to use if they ever feel scared or worried  the university has a alert system that will send students based on how they choose a text  email or call when there is a dangerous situation occurring  i feel very safe on campus  using computers on campus are great there are multiple places for students to access a computer to do what they need  if you need to print something students pay a very little amount to print their assignment  the wifi is okay and sometime does tend to be very slow but it gets me to what i need to view most of the time  the policies at this school are like most  here the school is big on the honor code and banning the use of drugs  drinking on or near campus  because of this students feel safe and make the right choices  the fan support and school spirit is pretty okay at the school with a few students being into the fun scene while other tends to stand and watch from afar  sports are not a big thing at the school  at least not enough for all to be active and supportive  like any university there are many types of guys or girls you will meet  everyone is different in their own way and i think this school has a diverse group of guys and girls  there are rarely any good parties at this school  most parties are either at a different school near the campus students can take a shuttle service to the mall  stores or grocery stores if needed  also near by is a football stadium for people who are fans of football and there is a concert hall for concert events students can drive to see depending on where you live on campus and in which building the response varies  in the building i live the building is nice  clean and spacious  there are two options for students to choose from either having a double which is a room with two people living in or a triple which is   separate rooms  in both choices the rooms have a sink  bathroom  triples have separate showers and toilets  and a living room as well  in my building the atmosphere is very quiet and easy to leave and enter the building  living in the south the weather is generally consistent with days of just sun or days of being cloudy  of course when the season changes it makes going to class more difficult  but for the most part the weather when it is nice  warm and sunny makes going out fun and easy  when it is raining and cold most students only leave their rooms or house when they must  at this university there are plenty of choices students can choose from such as american  italian  vietnamese  mexican  etc  at each location prices vary with some places being very affordable to some that are a little over priced  students who attend the school do receive a discount but it is not that significant  the only problem with off campus dining is the limited locations open for late night cravings  from what i have seen living on off campus housing is great  every building has a good security system so that occupants are safe  with each building there is a set area for parking  the off campus buildings are generally in walking distance to the campus and i know is a little more cheaper than living on campus in the dorms  with living off campus students are able to have access to their own kitchen which in dorms is something we do not have or there is a community kitchen  the nursing program at my school is very competitive  so to be able to get into the program i must maintain the best of the best grades  during orientation students who decide to pursue nursing are given the information regarding what classes are needed to be taken  exams and application due dates for entry into either the fall or spring nursing program  the workload is tough and very rigorous and takes up a majority of your time  as does any major  there are many facilities for students to study and ask for help if needed  the academics offered at my school is pretty great  there are many classes for students to choose from and decide to enroll in especially depending on their major  there are separate buildings for each specific subject and or major  professors are generally lenient and understanding of a students concerns and problems if such were to come up  also  professors give good and reasonable office hours for students who have questions or need more help  registration is a confusing process especially if you are new to the school but guidance does a good job to explain and tell students how and where to register during orientation  once classes start the workload is dependent on your class choice  honors or not  and most of the lessons are pre told to students so that they know what to expect  nothing is a surprise  most students study in the library  lounges  dorm rooms  outside if weather permits  dining options on campus are great  at this university there is a cafe where it is all you can eat from students who live on campus or off campus  though all students must have a meal plan to enter  in the cafe there are multiple stations such as a wrap station  a burger station  comfort food  pasta  pizza  salad bar  dessert bar for students and staff  if the cafe is not something you prefer then there are other places such as chick fil a  panda express  pizza hut  subway  starbucks  einstein and bros  there is a variety of choices students can choose from when it comes to deciding what and where to eat  all these places also except the university s meal plan of  dining dollars  which is an additional amount of money students receive when they purchase a meal plan  meal plans vary from options for on campus students who can choose from an unlimited plan to a limited     meal plan  off campus students also have available meal plan options as well that are some what similar to the on campus meal plans  the dining dollars do also carry over to the new semester if students do not use up all of their dollars  the use of drugs is barely seen on the campus of my university  i barely ever see anyone using drugs or selling drugs  there  at least from what i have seen  have never been pressured to try or do drugs unless they actively decide to try the drug  the university i attend has a no drug no smoking policy on campus which means no use of drugs or cigarettes is permitted on campus at all hours  dark unless their is a sports activity going onlots of armed phone robberies and lack of overall patrol at nightclasses are to the point i have not received a lot of financial aid  less than a fourth of my tuition per semester  i ve applied to a lot of scholarships but haven t received any yet nothing too crazy  but it is about   mins away from dallas  where there are a lot of things to do if you are in intro classes  you are going to have a lot of trouble getting your hands on a computer the work is not too bad if you do  do it  the staff in my major is very picky  they are always trying to somehow put a barrier to your goals and your class choices there is a big diversity group around campus  and everyone pretty much gets along lately there have been a lot of on campus robberies  it s not bad but my building it s a little depressing considering it is a  fine arts  building  the staff is very picky  some teachers are great and some are okay parking is usually not an issueâ€¦ at least around my building the building is not too bad the gym is my favorite hangout sometimes it s hot  sometimes it s coldâ€¦ you never know with texas weather on my building  fine arts  there is just one place to eat i don t really eat on campus because i know it will make me fat it s a part of college  and if you re of age then it s up to you to partake in these activities  but underage drinking can lead to very bad things and should be looked at as a very important thing to cut down on college campuses  i ve lived on campus and i can t say that i loved it  but it was okay enough to live in i feel safe mostly during the day among the other students  but at night is when i feel like i could be in danger around other humans walking around  i just want to get to my car  but i have to be on high alert to make sure i don t get mugged or taken everyone leaves campus because there s nothing to do on campuswhen we get ice  the sidewalks are awful and slicksome really good days and some really bad dayseveryone s different and accepting of everyone there isn t a football team at uta  that accounts for a lot of non support from students and also for the lack of importance of athletics  we need to have a football team  it s texas  most of the professors i ve had seem to be quite knowledgeable  the registration process is fairly easy and the workload just depends on the professor  so far  the workload doesn t seem too bad there are professional games to attend like baseball and football  lots of shopping areas  and six flags  it s a pretty well rounded area  but i would only live in arlington if i found a good enough job to convince me to move there there are a lot of options off campus  a lot of chain restaurants and also a lot of unique ethnic restaurants are ound locally  i haven t been to all of them so i m not sure about the costs  i am a nursing major and even though i am not in the program yet  i chose this school because i know it has one of the best nursing programs in the state  the maverick activities center is great  it has a lot of equipment and even offers zumba  it s pretty awesome  i would say that overall  the campus is pretty lenient on attendance  since i have been attending this school  spring        hardly any of my professors have taken attendance  the campus is very strict with parking  i always see security going around and checking cars to make sure they have a permit  however  i m pretty sure the school enforces this so much just so it will make more money by fining people every single day  at night  the campus should be more lit  the lights are not that bright and there is maybe only one escort that i ever see  if i see one  outside of the central library  there should be more emergency phones available because i think they are just too far apart  this past semester  fall       there were so many crimes that occurred which now make me feel like i am unsafe on campus  especially if walking alone  which is most of the time  rni think it is a good idea that once midnight  security goes around the library to check student ids  however  i think they should also go into the bathrooms to check those people s ids as well because it is possible that non students could be hiding in there while security is going around to check  i think campus safety should become more of a priority the value of the food is a little expensive for college students since we are always on a budget  if a student eats   meals a day on campus in the uc  it s more than    most of the time and it also sucks that every single item is a la carte  nothing comes as a meal combo  which definitely makes eating on campus expensive  there should be specials on food since we are paying so much for tuition  books  and parking  also  the service of the employees is not that great either and the food is not always fresh or hot  if i could do it all over again  i would choose this school  it has a great nursing program  lots of diversity  many clubs and organizations  and lots of events  i also enjoy the central library  especially the quiet floors  however  during finals  there is hardly anywhere to sit and study  all of the cubicles are taken  also  throughout the library  there should be more outlets to plug in electronic devices  there are definitely not enough compared to the size of the library  college park center is new and amazing    the mac there are attractive people  but not everywhere people drink and smoke  but that s about it easy process  excellent options available mostly rundown apartments on cooper street  dell desktop computers are available  and also imac labs decent school if you want to get a degree from an average state university  opportunities are available if you look for them it s texas  every texan knows what to expect in this  bi polar  weather  but in the end  it is very enjoyable to see the campus change from summer to fall more options are needed  other then the   first time freshman  scholarships   and if you lose a scholarship  it should be the students right to at least have a chance of getting it back   if an assignment needed to be typed  e mailed  or printed  uta s computer labs were the place for me so far uta has been great to me  other than the fact that i lost my scholarship because i was a ut cap student  ut ausitin was and is my dream school  that s the only thing that keeps me from being fully satisfied with my campus  however  i barely finished my first semester  and the aforementioned might just change the campus s strictness is  not to strict   and not even close to  average  for the most part  fun is welcomed as long as everyone follows the rules  which is perfect for me i have gone to uta s health center about a couple times or so  the service is great an all  but with a population the size of uta  either the center must become larger  or a second one must be built before i can give it an  it s excellent  review not on the top of people s minds  uta s athletic department is very underrated  however  if enough attention if brought  i m sure one day they will be as popular as any ut austin game  not to mention  our track team  cross country team  and basketball team are already major competitors in their conferences with many places to hang out at or around uta  the word  boring  will only be caused by doing nothing being an international business major opens up a lot of door  not just at uta  but outside in the work force  for example  when i was at orientation for my first job and was asked if i was going to attend college  my answer  involving uta and my major  brought impressed faces to the people in the room  when the going gets tough  the tough gets going   if a class is getting the best of you  don t fear  for the professors are always there for your assistance rnwith the new  college park center   the brain warming atmosphere in the  central library   the memorable  maverick stadium   band life   the  connection cafe   the king of interactions   and the most popular  maverick activities center   uta is definitely a place to reconsider i enjoy uta s diversity   it has welcomed me to a whole new world  on top of that  the professors are very understandable when it comes to being a college student  classes may be get difficult  but office hours are always available  honestly  i m surprised uta is not int the same tier as a m and ut austin  but i m sure it will get there uta has welcomed me to a drug free environment  sure  there have been a few frat parties that have been known for their use of alcohol  but in the end  the option to partake is up to the individual i m a commuter and don t really get to see much of uta s nightlife  but when i have stayed late for band practices and it s activities  i ve seen only very little socialization the university of texas at arlington is one of the most diversed schools in the nation  and acceptance is a common sight throughtout the campus the  connection cafe  at the university of texas at arlington always lightens things up after a long day of studying there is not too much going on  i would rather stay at home with friends i did not see nor hear about drug use on my campus my financial aid process was somewhat confusing  but not awful  i have not really started my major but the classes so far are interesting some professors are very passionate about what they teach there are things to do in arlington and people often drive to other places around the city it has been ok so far and i have met a lot of peoplewe have a health center that is available to students the college park center is home to new restaurants i don t live on campus so i am not sure how it is likethere are some parities but you have to go outside of campus to find good ones  the mac is a new workout center that has a lot of equipment available  there are many things to get involved with you just have to figure out what they are  there is not transportation in arlington  it has barely started a trial transportation program and there are some shuttle buses on campus but if you want to go anywhere else you need a car  there is wifi locations pretty much all over campus but sometimes it is better if you have your own laptop then rely on the library because it gets crowded there are some choices but they can be pricey they give the run around a lotim not really a party personi prefer eating at the plazai don t really like the parking meters and reasons for ticketing is ridiculousnot many are available to me the school is very diverse  so there are people of all races and preferences classes are very difficult and often departmental  but that is engineering  is it not workload is way too much  compared to other colleges i have attended  but i expected it   great opportunities for my major after graduation though not sure about the internships  trying to get my first one now  but if you are like me  with less than a        good luck i am not sure how much the school crime has changed  but the police do a great job keeping the students aware of incidents they have new engineering and sports facilities  but they are not for class use its okay    at least they offer starbucks at the main library and university center i am not a dorm resident  so i can only rate from what i hear and read in the school paper one cafeteria to eat at for   bucks meal   unless you get a meal card    otherwise it is a panda express  pizza or chicken sandwiches   or walk a few blocks for something else arlington is in between dallas and ft  worth  so there is plenty to do within a thirty minute ride   not much to do in arlington unless you are a football or baseball fan with lots of money the city just began public bus routes this year and it costs almost as much as driving a car because you have to change busses several times and pay additional fees if you are not on the direct route  the school shuttles are okay though for getting around the school most assignments require computer assistance and although the school has computers  many are broken within a month of class onset and the ones available are usually occupied with a student surfing facebook  uta pushes diversity too much   most students in my classes are foreign and i often find it difficult to network with other students because many of these students only associate with other students from their home countries i don t  know  i am not in a frat the parking costs are way too high and unless you are a staff member you will have to walk at least a half mile and up to   city blocks to find a parking spot  my classes usually start at    am   but i have to get there by      to get a decent parking spot   don t dare leave for lunch or you will regret it   i am an engineering student  so i don t get much time to get involved with sports activities  but other students seem to enjoy them university of texas at arlington is an extremely diverse and accepting campus who offers acceptance to all which is another example of experiencing the real world meeting all sorts of people being in texas  the weather can sometimes be predictable  it s mostly hot  but when it s colder than usual  you can expect cancellations which is great because they think about the students and the staff s safety they offer meal plan options which i like  they have cool locations and options of food on campus  walking from  my dorm it literally takes two minutes for me to walk to get something to eat there is a very strict policy of no drugs on campus and enforcement of it i received financial aid but as far as scholarships  i met the criteria but didn t receive any school sponsored scholarships which was ridiculous but of course they did offer me the option of loans personally   i haven t met that many greek members  they aren t a huge part of the campus but they are always promoting their fraternity or sorority there s a diverse amount of them the university offers a great number of computer labs and resources they are mostly mac computers and they are very fast  there is wifi all around campus available to students and the faculty our best known sport is basketball  they need to have a football team it would bring way more people in resulting in ore money  the new president has made clear that he doesn t see football in the future  that is the major downfall of going to university of texas at arlington i don t stay off campus but from what i have experienced  the off campus apartments are by a busy intersection  but the school does provide a shuttle for the off campus locations to tell you the truth  my school doesn t really have an out of control night life  which isn t a bad thing  they are very strict about drugs on campus and alcohol usage in the dorms there is a lot of off campus dining options they all offer good prices and some offer student discounts they could be better about letting students know they have discounts though around ut arlington  there is a large mall  a baseball and football stadium including various restaurants and shops around the area i have good professors so far  the registration process is highly organized because of uta s exclusive and competitive nursing program  it causes a lot of pressure and stress to get in they only let a small number of people in  if anything i think they should change increase that small number and to be more realistic the university of texas at arlington is a very diverse college  in fact  it is rated the  th diverse college of the nation  because of all the different cultures of students  it gives us students a taste of the real world  they are less expensive than other institutions they provide a comfortable campus life for students like myself who stay on campus  i can honestly say i love my dorm room and its central location on the campus i am enjoying being a student at uta so far the university of texas at arlington has an amazing athletics center  it s referred to as the  mac   it has an indoor track  and plentiful work out equipment  the library is great  it s huge and has plenty of resources like the writing center to name a few to help aid students not many drugs are on campus  just alcohol  but usually the alcohol holders are at least    greeks are greek they have activities and are picky about their social circle scholarships limited to specific majors texas weather changes randomly  at times even the weather reporters can t get it right the more people you know the more parties you ll be introduced to just average  nothing head turning a lot more housing areas are being built there are a lot more options in neighboring cities not too big  not too small  very diverse and good size advisors are very helpful in finding internshipsnot much public transportation  but the school works well without it if you do not like the weather in texas    give it ten minutesfills quickly  so get there earlyi can t afford to eat out labs are located in a variety of places around campus again  i stick to myself good programs  but small schooli stick mostly to myself i m totally happy with living off campus  i actually just bike to school when the weather is acceptable  it takes like   minutes to get to campus where i livei m okay with the weather its not random  in the winter we did get ice  so they closed the campus for couple of days to let the ice melt if you want the night life its not hard to find it i m just not one of those students  it was a simple task  i filled out the application that was needed  need they sent me the possible funding they will provide me and i decided to accept them or notthe ethnicity of the school is very broad  i think it s cool to be able to look around and see so many students with different backgrounds  then the option of doing something on campus is always there you just need to go ask    on campus there are three libraries  main library  fine art  architecture library  then the science   engineering library  there are always campus events to attend to  all the students on campus all seem to be friendly to the other random student  the campus has a shuttle that goes from various spots on campus to the local off campus apartments and off campus parking lots  i m happy with the major i chose  i have a interest in the field it covers  its a little stressful though  i don t have one but i plan on to get one  for its required for my major there isn t a football team at uta the great sport that is greatly known for is the wheelchair basketball team i wouldn t really know i live in a off campus apartment near by  i m only on campus for classes or to get a bite to eat between classesi ve not really done much with the school  but the option to do something is always there  it s nice we have our own health clinic  it s great service and great price too there are computer labs in each of the three libraries on campus there are big parking lots all over campus  i would saw that its nice  but you might be far from your class depending on what parking lot you choose i ve never come across any major drinking or drug issues  i haven t noticed any problems concerning diversity  we have a good range of students who seem to be very accepting i don t live on campus but i haven t heard any major complaints about the housing i drive my car to school and other than having to park way out  i haven t had any problems not too much school spirit  but the facilities are nice and always kept up i haven t seen much in the field of internships or student research opportunities  i wish they had more out there for biology students or at least helped us become more aware of them  i haven t used them much but from what i can tell  there is a good number of computers and they work well there seems to be a lot of crime around the campus  but no so much at campus  i like that i get alerts straight to my phone of crime watch warnings a little confusing at times  but figured it out eventually depends on the professor and what their policy is they will work with you if you have problems do lots of research on the dorms and ask around be involved in your major and it s awesome some programs are more competitive than others it s only bad when you have to walk everywhere depends on who you know and how they act computer labs are helpful but they aren t open alotit will be best to walk with at least one person it depends on who you know get a car if you go off campus a lot parking is the absolute worst their rules are lenient and easy to follow get involved on campus  you will definitely have funmen s basketball is the most popular sport the university of arlington spend a lot of time on get students involve in sport activities  there is a good school spirit and athletic facilities  arlington is a small city and there are not much going on nothing bad happened at ut arlington because arlington is a small and safe city  everything at uta is within a walking distance so if you live on campus you don t need to have a car  car are needed for students who live off campus  the local weather does not affect the campus because building has great heating and air conditional system  there a different variety of food and coffee  price are decent  professors are friendly and well prepared  they really pay close attention to help students to success by having flexible hours after class in case student have problem on a specific subject  excellent instructor who speak the language they teach and provide different advice on how to success in the major being study  for instance there is opportunity to study abroad and practice  the language being teach  '"
